In this paper, we present insights from a novel Agent Based Model (ABM), applied to a London case study of surface water flood risk, designed to assess the interplay between different adaptation options; how risk reduction could be achieved by homeowners and government; and the role of flood insurance and the new flood insurance pool, Flood Re, in the context of climate change. The analysis highlights that while combined investment in property-level flood protection and sustainable urban drainage systems reduce surface water flood risk, the benefits can be outweighed by continued development in high risk areas and the effects of climate change. In our simulations, Flood Re is beneficial in its function to provide affordable insurance, even under climate change. However, the scheme does face increasing financial pressure due to rising surface water flood damages. If the intended transition to risk-based pricing is to take place then a determined and coordinated strategy will be needed to manage flood risk, which utilises insurance incentives, limits new development, and supports resilience measures. Our modelling approach and findings are highly relevant for the ongoing regulatory and political approval process for Flood Re as well as for wider discussions on the potential of insurance schemes to incentivise flood risk management and climate adaptation in the UK and internationally.

Urban planning and design are effective tools in dealing with climate adaptation and mitigation issues. However, climate risk and its impacts are multiscale and complex due to interdependence between urban infrastructure systems. Identifying adaptation strategies to cope with these impacts requires planners to understand potential interdependent and interrelated consequences of infrastructure failure under natural hazards, and evaluate cascading and cumulative effects of climate change. This article discussed opportunities and challenges to incorporate interdependent social and physical infrastructure systems in the adaptation planning and hazard mitigation process, including climate hazard assessment, adaptation goal identification, adaptation strategy development, and implementation. The availability of urban big data and high computational resources will enable urban planners and decision-makers to better deal with those complex impacts from climate change and natural hazards. Successful adaptation planning and hazard mitigation for interdependent infrastructure systems also needs to solve issues in uncertainties of climate projection, institutional barriers of adaptation, and challenges of urban big data. Potential solutions to these challenges would include cooperation among multidisciplinary experts, coordination between different levels of governments, and developing the ethical framework for data protection and robust methodologies to detect and reduce data bias.', 'Flood risk is increasing worldwide and there is a growing need to better understand the co-benefits of investments in disaster resilience. Utilizing a multinational community flood resilience dataset, this paper takes a systems approach to understanding community-level flood resilience. Using a cluster analysis and bivariate correlation methods, we develop a typology of community flood resilience capacity based on community characteristics and five capitals (human, financial, natural, physical, and social). Our results reinforce the importance of context-specific policymaking and give recommendations of four distinct clusters to investigate the relationship between flood resilience and prevailing development conditions. We especially find that communities with higher interactions between their capital capacities tend to have higher flood resilience levels. Additionally, there are indications that stronger interactions between community capacities can help to induce multiple co-benefits when investing in disaster resilience. Our results also have important policy implications on the individual community level. For example, based on our results, we suggest that communities with lower flood resilience capacities and interactions can best build resilience on leveraging their relatively higher human capital capacities to strengthen the financial and social capitals. Negative effects might happen for urban communities when co-benefits of natural and physical capital are not fully integrated. The highest flood resilience capacity is found in communities with a well-balanced household income distribution which is likely a contributing factor to the importance of financial capital for this cluster. Our results emphasize the importance of an integrative approach to management when implementing systematic flood disaster resilience metrics and development measures.']",NA,NA,

Therefore, identifying methods of using limited urban spaces to alleviate heat islands has become an urgent issue. In this study, we assessed the spatiotemporal evolution of urban heat islands within the central urban area of Fuzhou City, China from 2010 to 2019. This assessment was based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) model and an urban thermal environment spatial network constructed using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Optimization measures for the spatial network were proposed to provide a theoretical basis for alleviating urban heat islands. The results show that the heat island area within the study area gradually increased while that of urban cold island area gradually decreased. The core area was the largest of the urban heat island patch landscape elements with a significant impact on other landscape elements, and represented an important factor underlying urban heat island network stability. The thermal environment network revealed a total of 197 thermal environment corridors and 93 heat island sources. These locations were then optimized according to the current land use, which maximized the potential of 1599.83 ha. Optimization based on current land use led to an increase in climate resilience, with effective measures showing reduction in thermal environment spatial network structure and function, contributing to the mitigation of urban heat island. These findings support the use of current land use patterns during urban heat island mitigation measure planning, thus providing an important reference basis for alleviating urban heat island effects.', 'High air temperature and high humidity, combined with low wind speeds, are common trends in the tropical urban climates, which collectively govern heat-induced health risks and outdoor thermal comfort under the given hygrothermal conditions. The impact of different urban land-uses on air temperatures is well-documented by many studies focusing on the urban heat island phenomenon; however, an integrated study of air temperature and humidity, i.e., the human-perceived temperatures, in different land-use areas is essential to understand the impact of hot and humid tropical urban climates on the thermal comfort of urban dwellers for an appraisal of potential health risks and the associated building energy use potential. In this study, we show through near-surface monitoring how these factors vary in distinct land-use areas of Kuala Lumpur city, characterized by different morphological features (high-rise vs. low-rise; compact vs. open), level of anthropogenic heating and evapotranspiration (built-up vs. green areas), and building materials (concrete buildings vs. traditional Malay homes in timber) based on the calculated heat index (HI), apparent temperature (T-App) and equivalent temperature (T-E) values in wet and dry seasons. The results show that the felt-like temperatures are almost always higher than the air temperatures in all land-use areas, and this difference is highest in daytime temperatures in green areas during the dry season, by up to about 8 degrees C (HI)/5 degrees C (T-App). The T(E)values are also up to 9% higher in these areas than in built-up areas. We conclude that tackling urban heat island without compromising thermal comfort levels, hence encouraging energy use reduction in buildings to cope with outdoor conditions requires a careful management of humidity levels, as well as a careful selection of building morphology and materials.', 'Extreme events related to climate change are increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration worldwide. Europe is identified as a heatwave hotspot, with trends three-to-four time faster than the northern mid-latitudes; effects of heatwaves are combined in urban contexts with the heat island phenomenon, making cities critical for climate risk prevention and management. Land surface temperature represents an essential parameter for assessing the intensity of thermal impact on urban ecosystems and on public health. This parameter is widely used to map and assess urban heat islands in light to support climate-resilient adaptation planning. The general aim of this study is to assess urban heat island intensity, during a significant heatwave, in a critical heat-related risk region in Southern Italy (Salento). Specific objectives are 1) assessing climate change trends for heat-related extremes (hot days and heatwaves), 2) calculating urban heat islands intensity at regional and urban scale, 3) assessing spatial relationships among thermal intensity and urban characteristics (soil sealing and surface albedo). Identification of heatwaves is based on climatological data and statistical analyses; spatial thermal analyses and correlations are based on Landsat-8 imagery while land cover data are derived from ortho-photos. Climate analyses show a notable increase of the maximum annual temperature of 0.5 degrees C per decade, with an increase of eight hot days per decade. Spatial analyses on thermal impact highlight that urban heat island intensity is much lower within cities and towns than in rural areas, showing a reverse effect compared to the typical microclimatic characteristics of urban contexts. In fact, thermal intensity in the city of Lecce ranges from -11 degrees C to 5.6 degrees C. Also, by NDVI analyses, we found that permeable surfaces were 2 degrees C higher than impermeable surfaces, with statistically significant differences. Results from albedo analysis suggest that the characteristics of building material in historical sectors of cities may play a crucial role in this reverse effect of urban heat islands. Further studies are required to better investigate the contribution of different factors in this context.']",NA,Heatwaves,Health & well-being

The dichotomy between adaptation and mitigation, which arguably creates uncertainty at the implementation level, for example, is shaped by the role of the actors involved. In this regard, this study aims to investigate the interests and role of stakeholders in climate change adaptation at the national and regional levels in Indonesia. The country, Indonesia, is selected because it produces the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions, and the people are at the highest risk of the impacts of climate change in the world. Furthermore, this study discusses the challenges in climate change adaptation in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - This research uses a literature review and interviews with potential stakeholders. Purposive sampling methods were applied to select stakeholders for interviews. Interviews with key stakeholders were conducted through email and Zoom. Questions were developed based on the roles and interests of stakeholders. Findings - According to the stakeholders, there is a need to establish links between climate change adaptation and local policy at the national and regional levels. The results reveal no integration strategy or approach to support climate change adaptation. Although there has been some climate change adaptation, few people are widely regarded as authorities on climate change policy. This study also discusses some challenges and opportunities to engage key stakeholders in Indonesia. Originality/value - The study offers an understanding of stakeholders based on key stakeholders' interests and role in climate change adaptation in Indonesia. The research findings in this study generate prospects for the government or decision-makers or other stakeholders to deliberately aspire for policy planning. In addition, to prepare climate change adaptation policies relating to the role of stakeholders or community-based approaches to climate change adaptation, stakeholders can conduct more detailed studies to achieve community resilience in term of climate change adaptation."", 'In 2012, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) moved from a vulnerability to a risk-based conception of climate change adaptation. However, there are few examples of work that translates this approach into climate change adaptation practice, in order to demonstrate the practical utility of following a risk-based approach to adapting to climate change. The paper explores critically the differing conceptions of vulnerability and risk across the literature relating to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. The paper also examines a selection of spatially focused climate change vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies in this context. In doing so, we identify issues with the availability of spatial data to enable spatial risk-based climate change assessments. We argue that the concept of risk is potentially favorable in helping cities to understand the challenges posed by climate change, identify adaptation options, and build resilience to the changing climate. However, we suggest that change is needed in the way that practitioners and policymakers engage with risk-based concepts if they are to be embed into climate change adaptation activities.', ""In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.', ""Future cities will need to plan and design urban green spaces and woodlands to meet diverse interests and needs, provide ecosystem services required by an evolving urban society and improve continuity between urban and rural spaces. This future planning approach calls for more sustainable patterns of urban growth, where forests and green spaces can help create more sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities, and address the challenges of a growing urban population. Green areas are of strategic significance because in addition to absorbing harmful pollutants, improving temperatures, and mitigating the impacts of climate change, they have a positive effect on people's health and well-being and help to create inclusive societies. The values considered are manifold and a multi-criteria assessment, including an evaluation of citizens' perceived needs, allowing policy-makers to steer choices towards green-oriented urban planning tools, where green spaces and urban forests enable them to meet the challenges of future cities. The research presented here is part of this line of study in order to propose a tool to support stakeholders' decisions on urban green planning. The objectives of the study are to find out about the perception of urban green spaces and examine what kind of relationship should be established between the local authority and the population with regard to information and participation in the planning of green areas.

First, questions that are too large for a single country or discipline to address revolve around two issues: (a) how urban green spaces will be affected by socio-demographic and environmental drivers, such as climate change, and (b) how to plan and manage urban green spaces for the benefit of urban dwellers and biodiversity in the face of these changes. Second, questions that have a local origin, but are of international interest deal with, e.g. ecosystem services, urban resilience and human health as well as planning, management and governance of urban green spaces. A research framework for studying these issues should incorporate concepts from natural and social sciences. Ecosystem services approach could form a core of such an framework also integrating the spatial dimension (landscape ecology). Comparative research at the global scale is important to increase our understanding of the variation in urban green spaces and the ecosystem services they provide.

Due to climate change, urbanization, and lack of effective water resource management, countries like Pakistan are facing difficulties coping with the increasing water demand. Rapid urbanization and non-resilient infrastructures are the key barriers in sustainable urban water resource management. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges of urban water management through effective means. We propose a workflow for the modeling and simulation of sustainable urban water resource management and develop an integrated framework for the evaluation and planning of water resources in a typical urban setting. The proposed framework uses the Water Evaluation and Planning system to evaluate current and future water demand and the supply gap. Our simulation scenarios demonstrate that the demand-supply gap can effectively be dealt with by dynamic resource allocation, in the presence of assumptions, for example, those related to population and demand variation with the change of weather, and thus work as a tool for informed decisions for supply management. In the first scenario, 23% yearly water demand is reduced, while in the second scenario, no unmet demand is observed due to the 21% increase in supply delivered. Similarly, the overall demand is fulfilled through 23% decrease in water demand using water conservation. Demand-side management not only reduces the water usage in demand sites but also helps to save money, and preserve the environment. Our framework coupled with a visualization dashboard deployed in the water resource management department of a metropolitan area can assist in water planning and effective governance.', ""Recently, due to extreme climate change, damage from flooding has been increasing; however, water shortages are being announced simultaneously. Moreover, the water distribution system's ability to supply consumers is being overwhelmed because of urbanization, population concentration, and increases in water consumption. For this reason, to solve the water shortage problem, water reuse technologies are developing and improving that perform simple chemical treatment processes to reuse water for flushing toilets, washing, gardening, etc. but not as drinking water. However, most water reuse systems are designed and operated as independent systems, such as reusing water used in individual buildings or using rainwater. Therefore, this study develops an optimal design for the combined water systems, which is modeling and designing water distribution systems, urban drainage systems, and water reuse systems simultaneously to solve the water shortage and reduce flooding damage. To consider the combined water systems design, the existing water distribution system (WDS) demand is divided into drinking water and other uses, and the resource of other water is assumed by the rainwater storage tank for covering the amount of exceeding precipitation. To derive optimal design solutions for the combined three water systems, single- and multi-objective optimization techniques are applied considering various design criteria (i.e., construction cost, system resilience, and flooding volume on the exceeding design rainfall intensity). The developed combining water system design techniques could be used to create designs that solve the problems of medium and long-term water shortages and sustainable water systems development."", ""Urban water metabolism focuses on measuring water inflows and outflows within a defined urban system. As an emerging concept, it provides valuable understandings into water flow dynamics, supporting evidence-based decision-making. One approach to quantify these flows is the urban water mass balance method, which accounts for both human-induced and natural water resources. By equating these flows, it identifies whether water movement within the system is linear or circular. The primary goal of water mass balance analysis is to assess how closely a city aligns with water-sensitive management approaches. However, urban metabolism studies are rare in developing countries, where cities often lack the experience to estimate water inflows and outflows for informed water-sensitive interventions. This study addresses this gap by analyzing Adama city in Ethiopia using the water mass balance method to measure its water metabolism. The result revealed that the city faces a negative water balance with outflows exceeding inflows by 46.89 million cubic meters annually. The results indicated that Adama's water flow follows a linear take-make-use-dispose model. The imbalance in Adama's water cycle is driven by urbanization, impervious surfaces, and climate change, which increase runoff and evaporation. The study found that 61.3% of the city's water comes from a centralized system, with 90% sourced from distant rivers through a telecoupling system. In the city, inadequate water harvesting, high population density and intensive water use are worsening water scarcity. Urban water metabolism indicators reveal significant losses and indicating the need for water conservation efforts. Despite the reliance on centralized systems, the study identifies strong potential for decentralized solutions and alternative water harvesting. To tackle these challenges, the research recommends adopting water-sensitive strategies such as low-impact development, sustainable urban drainage systems, and water-sensitive urban design and planning. These approaches can reduce the negative effects of urbanization, mitigate urban water scarcity risks and improve water management through water sensitive management approach. The study also emphasizes the need for collaborative learning, community involvement, and innovative technologies, supported by legal frameworks to ensure effective water wise interventions. Shifting toward circular water management and decentralized water systems will boost Adama's resilience and promote sustainable water resource management, making the city more internally self-sufficient.""]",NA,climate change,Water and sanitation

Different dimensions of drought influence tree stem radial growth independently or jointly, which makes the development of accurate predictions a formidable challenge. Measurement-based tree-ring data have obvious advantages for studying the drought responses of trees. Here, we explored the use of abundant tree-ring records for quantifying regional response patterns to key dimensions of drought. Specifically, we designed a series of regional-scaled natural experiments, based on 357 tree-ring chronologies from Southwest USA and location-matched monthly water balance anomalies, to reveal how tree-ring responds to each dimension of drought. Our results showed that tree-ring was affected significantly more by the water balance condition in the current hydrological year than that in the prior hydrological year. Within the current hydrological year, increased drought frequency (number of dry months) and duration (maximum number of consecutive dry months) resulted in cumulative effects which amplified the impacts of drought on trees and reduced the drought resistance of trees. Drought events that occurred in the pregrowing seasons strongly affected subsequent tree stem radial growth. Both the onset timing and severity of drought increased legacy effects on tree stem radial growth, which reduced the drought resilience of trees. These results indicated that the drought impact on trees is a dynamic process: even when the total water deficits are the same, differences among the drought processes could lead to considerably different responses from trees. This study thus provides a conceptual framework and probabilistic patterns of tree-ring growth response to multiple dimensions of drought regimes, which in turn may have a wide range of implications for predictions, uncertainty assessment, and forest management.', 'Climate change has dramatically altered the frequency and intensity of droughts, thereby altering tree growth. Understanding whether tree growth in semiarid areas in response to long-term drought and the post-drought recovery rate of tree growth vary along moisture gradients is crucial for predicting future forest change. Here, we assessed the spatial variation in both the growth resistance of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) to long-term drought and its post-drought recovery using a stand-total sampling strategy along a moisture gradient that covered three sites (with an annual precipitation of 330.4, 394.2, and 515.9 mm for the western, middle, and eastern sites, respectively) with six plots. Resistance and recovery were evaluated by analyzing the tree growth trends during a long-term drought period (1980-2001) and the subsequent post-drought period (2001-2013), respectively. Our results indicate that the trees with the highest temporal stability were those at the wetter eastern site; specifically, during the long-term drought period, the trees at the wetter eastern site showed the highest resistance (-0.015) and the lowest recovery (0.002). The trees in moderately arid conditions were much more sensitive to climate change than those at the relatively arid western site, showing the lowest resistance (-0.050) and highest recovery (0.020). Climate change had the strongest impact on tree growth at the moderately arid site, contributing 60.6% to the tree growth decreasing trend during the long-term drought period and 65.4% to the tree recovery during the post-drought period, respectively. Climate change had a lower impact on tree growth at the wet and dry sites, contributing less than 50% to the tree growth trends at these sites. The results indicate that a trade-off relationship exists between resistance and recovery at the different sites; that is, the highly resistant trees at the wetter eastern site tend to have lower recovery, whereas the weakly resistant trees at the moderately arid site tend to have higher recovery. These results have implications for predicting tree growth in response to future climate change.', ""AimThe intensity and frequency of drought have increased considerably during recent decades in some Northern Hemisphere forested areas, and future climate warming could further magnify drought stress. We quantify how forests resist drought events and recover after them, i.e. we determine their growth resilience. LocationNorth America and Europe. MethodsWe use a large tree-ring database to study how drought influences forest growth resilience. We selected 775 tree-ring width chronologies and studied the occurrence of years with extremely dry conditions (low soil moisture and/or high evaporative stress; hereafter drought') in these forests. For each drought in each forest we calculated three indices that represent different components of growth resilience to drought: resistance (Rt), recovery (Rc) and resilience (Rs). We related the variation in these indices with geographical, topographic, climatic and ecological conditions from each region. ResultsThe three components of forest growth resilience were interrelated. Resistance and recovery were negatively related, and both were positively and nonlinearly related to resilience. Drought resistance increased with latitude, soil moisture and slope, whereas drought recovery decreased with latitude, soil moisture and summer normalized difference vegetation index. Drought resilience increased with elevation and decreased with the variation in soil moisture. Temperate broadleaf forests from wet regions showed a greater growth resistance (e.g. north-eastern USA, central Europe) while conifer forests from dry to semi-arid regions (e.g. south-western USA, southern Europe) presented a greater growth recovery. Main conclusionsThe geographical patterns of growth resilience indices confirm the existence of different strategies among forests to cope with droughts, depending on the biome, the tree species and the prevailing climatic conditions. Geographical patterns in soil moisture availability tend to override species-specific responses to drought.""]",NA,drought,Ecosystems

In order to quantify the growth pattern of tidal flats and its response to changes in multiple external driving factors, here we established a geometric model, in combination with field surveys, to study the historical behavior (1127-1990) and future trends (2100) of a typical tidal flat system on the Jiangsu coast, China. The results indicate that sediment supply and relative sea level change determine the accretion-erosion status and the eventual morphological pattern of the tidal flat. If these two factors remain stable and sediment supply can compensate for the increase in sediment accommodation space caused by sea level change, the tidal flat will continue to accrete until its growth limit is reached. Otherwise, tidal flats will face erosion risk, which can be further enhanced by localized land subsidence. Furthermore, changes in the coastal profile show a trend of progressive retreating, with the lower part of intertidal zone being eroded more rapidly than its upper part. This demonstrates that the sediment supply has been reduced to such a level that the present in-transition evolution pattern of central Jiangsu coast will soon be replaced by severe inundation and erosion. Hence, we advocate for a comprehensive, multi-tiered coastal protection strategy focusing on wave suppression, enhancement of sediment retention, and increased storm resistance. This strategy underscores fundamental underlying mechanisms of the accretion-erosion transition, which is crucial for the future safeguarding of coastal wetlands globally. Tidal flats are important potential land resources. Over the Holocene period, under increased sediment from rivers has led to rapid growth in most coastal areas, supporting the prosperity of coastal cities. However, uncertainties exist regarding the limits of this growth, and global changes and human activities are causing tidal flats worldwide to shift from growth to erosion. To understand the tidal flats growth patterns and their response to future challenges, we developed a geometric model based on key processes. Field surveys and a millennium-scale study in eastern China support the model's reliability. Our findings highlight sediment supply and relative sea-level change as key factors in tidal flat evolution, with growth limitations even with sustained sediment supply. We propose a protective scheme based on tidal flat evolution mechanisms to enhance coastal resilience against global change.

The 100-year storm is simulated using a chain of stochastic and physics-based models combined with a scenario-based approach. Storm surge and wave spectral parameters, obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS), are used as boundary conditions for high-resolution wave simulations, performed in the coastal and inundation zones using the steady-state spectral wave model STWAVE. Selected scenarios are defined to assess the magnitude of the variability in predicted damage resulting from the uncertainty in SLR, erosion rate, and time at which the 100-year storm would occur. Erosion rates are based on empirical analyses of historic rates of shoreline change, SLR measurements, and coastal erosion theory. The risk is measured in terms of damage to individual houses, based on damage curves developed in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NACCS study. In addition, remediation scenarios are explored, demonstrating that a combination of dune replenishment and an increase in the residential resilience by elevating structures can significantly diminish the risk to the coastal community."", ""Coastal cities and their natural environments are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise (SLR). Hard coastal defences play a key role in protecting at-risk urban coastal populations from flooding and erosion, but coastal ecosystems also play important roles in the overall sustainability and resilience of cities and urban centres by contributing to coastal protection. Conserving coastal ecosystems and maximising their resilience will ensure that urban coastal communities can continue to benefit from ecosystem services and improve their adaptive capacity to cope with adverse impacts in the future. Using the hyper-urbanised coast of Singapore as a case study, we modelled the resilience of coastal wetlands to SLR and integrated resilience in conservation plan-ning. We found that the responses of coastal habitats to rising sea level vary across the modelling periods. While there is a slight net gain in the extent of mangrove forests and tidal flats by the end of the century due to potential habitat conversion, the existing habitats will experience a loss in coverage. Highly modified coastlines associated with urbanisation impede the ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward, which is a key mechanism for coastal habitats to cope with rising sea levels. Systematic conservation planning can identify sites that are potentially resilient to SLR and incorporate factors that influence an ecosystem's capability to respond to change. Crucially, the relatively slow rates of SLR and persistence of coastal wetlands during the earlier half of this century present an opportunity to introduce management interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.""]",NA,Coastal erosion,Infrastructure

This study aims to explore the impact of carbon emission reduction on urban resilience and its spatial -temporal characteristics with a sample of 267 prefectural-level cities from 2006 to 2019 in China. Firstly, this research conceptualizes urban resilience as economic prosperity, social wellbeing, cleaner environment and analyzes the impact mechanism of carbon emission reduction on these three dimensions. Then in the empirical analysis, the urban resilience assessment index is built to quantitatively evaluate urban resilience in Chinese cities and its spatial-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, the impact of carbon emission on urban resilience is investigated through geostatistical analysis. The results show that the urban resilience level in China shows significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. High resilience cities are clustered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta region and Pearl River Delta region, while lower resilience cities are in the northeast, northwest and southwest regions. Moreover, urban resilience in Chinese cities is mainly contributed by the economic subsystem. Over the study period, carbon emission reduction is positively related to urban resilience with high resilience and high carbon emission reduction agglomerated over space. Furthermore, the agglom-eration effect increased from 2006 to 2019. These indicate that in the past fifteen years, urban resilience in Chinese cities is highly dependent on regional economic development which is still reliant on emission-intensive industries. The research provides important references for China's carbon emission reduction and resilience -building policies. Spatial heterogeneities need to be acknowledged to focus on key areas of emission reduction and resilience improvement in policymaking and implementation."", ""The synergistic improvement in urban resilience and low-carbon development level is significant for mitigating and adapting to climate change, achieving the 'dual carbon goal' and promoting sustainable urban development. By constructing a comprehensive evaluation index system of urban resilience and low-carbon development, this study quantitatively measures the level of urban resilience and low-carbon development of the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA) from 2009 to 2021. Further, the coupling coordination degree model and geographical detector explore the spatial and temporal evolution pattern and driving factors of the coupling and coordination (CCD) of urban resilience and low-carbon development. The results show the following: (1) From 2009 to 2021, urban resilience shows a good momentum of continuous rise, and the spatial distribution pattern is 'high in the northeast and low in southwest'. Low-carbon development is characterized by the development trend of 'first decline and then rise', forming a spatial distribution pattern of 'high in the south and low in the northwest'. (2) The CCD also shows a rising development trend. The type of coupling and coordination is mainly reluctant coordination. (3) The CCD shows a significant spatial correlation, and the degree of spatial agglomeration shows a downward trend. (4) The level of economic development and the level of scientific and technological innovation are the main two driving forces for the spatial differentiation of the coordinated development of the two systems. In addition, the explanatory power of the interaction of various influencing factors was significantly enhanced. In a word, this study was helpful to clarify further the spatial interaction between urban resilience and low-carbon development and also to provide experience and reference for low-carbon resilience construction and high-quality development of other urban agglomerations in the world."", 'Climate change and rapid urbanization bring natural and anthropogenetic disturbance to the urban ecosystem, damaging the sustainability and resilience of cities. Evaluation of urban ecological resilience and an investigation of its impact mechanisms are of great importance to sustainable urban management. Therefore, taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration (BTHUA) region in China as a study area, this study builds an evaluation index to assess urban ecological resilience and its spatial patterns with the resilience surrogate of net primary production during 2000-2020. The evaluation index is constructed from two dimensions, including the sensitivity and adaptability of urban ecosystems, to capture the two key mechanisms of resilience, namely resistance and recovery. Resilience-influencing factors including biophysical and socio-economic variables are analyzed with the multiple linear regression model. The results show that during 2000-2020, the spatial pattern of urban ecological resilience in the BTHUA is characterized by high resilience in the northwest and relatively low resilience in the southeast. High resilience areas account for 40% of the whole region, mainly contributed by Zhangjiakou and Chengde city in Hebei Province, which is consistent with the function orientation of the BTH region in its coordinated development. Along with urbanization in this region, ecological resilience decreases with increased population and increases with GDP growth; this indicates that, although population expansion uses resources, causes pollution and reduces vegetation coverage, with economic growth and technological progress, the negative ecological impact could be mitigated, and the coordinated development of social economy and ecological environment could eventually be reached. Our findings are consistent with mainstream theories examining the ecological impact of socio-economic development such as the Environmental Kuznets Curve, Porter Hypothesis, and Ecological Modernization theories, and provide significant references for future urbanization, carbon neutrality, resilience building, and urban ecological management in China.']",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

This paper aims to propose a comprehensive framework to assess the resilience of urban road networks against rainstorm waterlogging disasters. We employ a scenario simulation method to analyze the impact of rainstorm waterlogging disasters on the road network and establish a resilience assessment framework based on both structural and functional performance. Within this framework, five distinct strategies are implemented to enhance road network resilience. The framework is applied to a case study of the downtown area of Xi'an, China. The results highlight the substantial impact of rainstorm intensity on urban road network resilience and suggest that analyzing critical road segments from the perspectives of importance and connectivity can significantly improve road network resilience. Notably, the arrangement of critical roads is pivotal in enhancing road network resilience. This research provides a theoretical reference for road network assessment and disaster reduction decision-making."", ""Purpose Recently, the serviceability of the transportation infrastructure in urban areas has become crucial. Any impact of the hazardous conditions on the urban road network causes significant disruption to the functioning of the urban region, making the city's resilience a point of concern. Thereby, the purpose of the study is to examine the city's recovery capacity to absorb the impacts of adverse events like urban floods. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the road network resilience for an urban flood event for zones proposed by the Municipal Corporation to develop multiple central business districts. This study proposes a novel approach to measure the resilience of road networks in an urban region under floods caused due to heavy rainfall. A novel Road Network Resilience Index (RNRI) based on the serviceability of the road network during floods is proposed, estimated using Analytic Hierarchy Process - Multiple Criteria Evaluation (AHP-MCE) approaches by using the change in street centrality, impervious area and road network density. This study examines and analyses the resilience of road networks in two conditions: flood and nonflood conditions. Resilience was estimated for both the conditions at the city level and the decentralized zone level. Findings Based on RNRI values, this study identifies zones having a lower or higher resilience index. The central, southern and eastern zones have lower road network resilience and western and northern zones have high road network resilience. Practical implications The proposed methodology can be used to increase road network resilience within the city under flood conditions. Originality/value The previous literature on road network resilience concentrates on the physical properties of roads after flood events. This study demonstrates the use of nonstructural measures to improve the resilience of the road network by innovatively using the AHP-MCE approach and street centrality to measure the resilience of the road network."", 'Urban road networks are often affected by natural disasters, such as rainstorms, with consequences spreading from partial failures to massive network-wide disruptions. The pattern of road network resilience is grasped by capturing the changes in the failure process of the road network cascade. This research presents a method for dynamic evaluation of road network resilience, with extreme rainstorm weather as the background. The fundamental diagram of traffic flow is adopted into the shock wave model to obtain the congestion propagation and dissipation model with speed as input quantity. Then, it is networked and applied to the road network to develop a cascading failure model. The model can be used to identify critical nodes, combining the Monte Carlo method and Dijkstra algorithm, as well as to construct time-varying evolution scenarios of road network resilience when critical nodes are broken. Furthermore, VA (the variations of all OD pairs in the road network) and RI (the resilience indicators of road network) indexes for dynamic evaluation of road network resilience are developed, that visualize the resilience of the road network for a specific region, a specific event, and a specific time. In the case study, the proposed method is employed to evaluate the resilience of the urban road network under a real case of the Zhengzhou 720 rainstorm in China, and its practicality is verified.']",NA,Flooding,Transportation

However, the mental health impacts of climate change, particularly concerning social inequality and gender dynamics, are less documented in the Global South. This paper focuses on the impact of climate change on women's mental health in two vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. This study employed qualitative methods, including, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions (FGDs). The communities were selected based on their vulnerability to climate change. A total of 80 participants were selected using snowball sampling, and 55 interviews and 6 FGDs were conducted. Women are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts on mental health due to their gender roles and responsibilities. Responsible for taking care of their families, they have to face additional challenges due to climate change impacts, such as increased workload, food insecurity, and social insecurity when their husband migrates to the cities for jobs. Women also face social and cultural barriers, which exacerbate their vulnerability to climate change impacts on mental health. Socioeconomic and environmental determinants appear to be embedded and lead to psychological suffering in relation to social roles and gender norms. Interventions should be designed to address the specific needs and challenges faced by women in these communities. Policymakers should take a gender-sensitive approach to address the mental health impacts of climate change in these communities. This study contributes to the growing body of research on the gendered impacts of climate change with a trajectory approach and provides insights for future research in this area."", ""Climate risks and vulnerability continue to disproportionately affect the urban poor given their constrained adaptive capacity. This paper examines the urban poor's perceptions and vulnerability to climate change in Kampala. Data was collected from a proportionate sample of 534 respondents drawn from households that were randomly selected from the city's informal settlements and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Six focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews were conducted whose participants were purposively selected because of their knowledge and experiences. Quantitative data was analyzed using chi-square tests while content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A total of 96.6% of the households were aware of climate change, mainly perceived as rising temperatures and reduction in rainfall. Floods (53.4%) and droughts (27%) were the most commonly experienced climate risks, with the former considered more frequent and severe. Perceptions and vulnerability to climate risk varied with incomes, education level, marital status, main occupation, housing conditions and length of stay. Individuals with less wealth and education, employed in informal business and having insecure housing tenure were most vulnerable to flooding than they are to drought. The sensitivity of the urban poor communities is heightened by ecosystem degradation, poor access to urban infrastructure, utilities and services. With socio-economic attributes highly associated to climate change vulnerabilities, incorporating social dimensions and exchange of information between the vulnerable communities, planners and decision makers is necessary to inform the city's adaptation policy and building long-term urban resilience. Partnerships are necessary between the urban authorities, communities, civil society and donors/financiers to improve housing and livelihoods in slums settlements. At the same time, strengthening co-production of climate information services, building climate change awareness, restoration of critical ecosystems and a broader inclusive adaptation planning are avenues for building resilient urban poor communities."", ""When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP. As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery.

We quantify and compare how different forest management strategies designed to increase forest resilience and health reduce the number of properties at risk from wildfire, focusing on the Lake Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada. We combine landscape change simulations (including climate change, wildfire, and management effects) with scenarios of current and plausible fuel treatment activities and parcel-scale fire risk analysis. Results suggest that more aggressive fuel treatment activities that treat more area on the landscape, whether through mechanical and hand thinning or prescribed fire, dramatically lower the fire probability in the region and lead to a corresponding lower risk of property loss. We estimate that relative to recent practices of focusing management in the wildland???urban interface, more active forest management can reduce property loss risk by 45%???76%, or approximately 2600???4900 properties. The majority of this risk reduction is for single family residences, which constitute most structures in the region. Further, we find that the highest risk reduction is obtained through strategies that treat a substantially greater area than is currently treated in the region and allows for selective wildfires to burn for resource objectives outside of the wildland???urban interface. These results highlight the importance of more active forest management as an effective tool in reducing the wildfire risk to capital assets in the region.', 'Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming. As a consequence, the wildland-urban interface is projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire; (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildlandurban interface to developing fire-adapted communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.', ""A growing body of research focuses on identifying patterns among human populations most at risk from hazards such as wildfire and the factors that help explain performance of mitigations that can help reduce that risk. Emerging policy surrounding wildfire management emphasizes the need to better understand such social vulnerability-or human populations' potential exposure to and sensitivity from wildfire-related impacts, including their ability to reduce negative impacts from the hazard. Studies of social vulnerability to wildfire often pair secondary demographic data with a variety of vegetation and wildfire simulation models to map potential risk. However, many of the assumptions made by those researchers about the demographic, spatial or perceptual factors that influence social vulnerability to wildfire have not been fully evaluated or tested against objective measures of potential wildfire risk. The research presented here utilizes self-reported surveys, GIS data, and wildfire simulations to test the relationships between select perceptual, demographic, and property characteristics of property owners against empirically simulated metrics for potential wildfire related damages or exposure. We also evaluate how those characteristics relate to property owners' performance of mitigations or support for fire management. Our results suggest that parcel characteristics provide the most significant explanation of variability in wildfire exposure, sensitivity and overall wildfire risk, while the positive relationship between income or property values and components of social vulnerability stands in contrast to typical assumptions from existing literature. Respondents' views about agency or government management helped explain a significant amount of variance in wildfire sensitivity, while the importance of wildfire risk in selecting a residence was an important influence on mitigation action. We use these and other results from our effort to discuss updated considerations for determining social vulnerability to wildfire and articulate alternative means to collect such information.

In a context of climate change, coastal ecosystems are exposed to erosion and subject to coastal squeeze, even as they provide natural coastal protection against extreme weather. While civil engineering solutions often take centre stage in mitigating coastal erosion and protecting infrastructure from storms and sea level rise, we seek to explore the social dimension of adaptive management of socio-ecological systems and more specifically the role of knowledge and learning. Using an ecosystem services (ES) framework, we provide a first evaluation of local stakeholders' perceptions of coastal habitats in maritime Quebec. The findings demonstrate the importance of a social approach for coastal ES valuation, in particular in addressing the complex question of cultural ES. A better understanding of the links between coastal stakeholders and their natural environment can help decision-makers and practitioners design conservation management and coastal adaptation measures mainstreaming the role of coastal habitats. Nevertheless, a change towards a socioecological perspective will require long-lasting processes that build on social capacities, such as flexible institutions and multilevel governance systems."", 'Coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. These impacts will exacerbate the risks posed by the continuing environmental degradation confronting the coastal communities. Adopting a participatory research approach, the study examines the vulnerability of socioeconomic groups among the coastal population in Cavite City, Philippines, their current adaptation strategies and their adaptive capacity to cope with the impacts of climate variability and extremes and sea-level rise. Under a future scenario of a 1-m accelerated sea-level rise (ASLR), the study also looks into its potential effects on these urban coastal communities and ecosystems. In the context of poverty reduction and sustainable development, this study suggests a local framework for integrating adaptation strategies and actions into integrated coastal management (ICM) planning.

(C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.', ""Worldwide, humans are facing high risks from natural hazards, especially in coastal regions with high population densities. Rising sea levels due to global warming are making coastal communities' infrastructure vulnerable to natural disasters. The present study aims to provide a coupling approach of vulnerability and resilience through restoration and conservation of lost or degraded coastal natural habitats to reclamation under different climate change scenarios. The integrated valuation of ecosystems and tradeoffs model is used to assess the current and future vulnerability of coastal communities. The model employed is based on seven different biogeophysical variables to calculate a natural hazard index and to highlight the criticality of the restoration of natural habitats. The results show that roughly 25% of the coastline and more than 5 million residents are in highly vulnerable coastal areas of mainland China, and these numbers are expected to double by 2100. Our study suggests that restoration and conservation in recently reclaimed areas have the potential to reduce this vulnerability by 45%. Hence, natural habitats have proved to be a great defense against coastal hazards and should be prioritized in coastal planning and development. The findings confirm that natural habitats are critical for coastal resilience and can act as a recovery force of coastal functionality loss. Therefore, we recommend that the Chinese government prioritizes restoration (where possible) and conservation of the remaining habitats for the sake of coastal resilience to prevent natural hazards from escalating into disasters. Plain Language Summary Coastal populations are especially at risk from sea-level rise (SLR), induced storm surges, and other natural hazards. Therefore, it becomes essential to analyze the current and future vulnerabilities of coastal regions to natural hazards. Furthermore, it is desirable for the policy and the decision making to propose the suitable approaches for the resilience enhancement. This paper analyzes the current and future vulnerability of mainland China's coast to the SLR-induced natural hazards using a natural hazard index incorporating a coupled approach to vulnerability and resilience. The results show that the restoration of lost mangroves (where possible) and conservation of remaining coastal natural habitats can reduce the future coastal vulnerability by 45%. This study confirms that natural habitats are significant for coastal resilience and the governments should prioritize them for the sake of coastal resilience to mitigate the impacts of natural hazards.""]",NA,Sea level rise,Ecosystems

Seen as one whole complex and grey system, the causal relationship between the social development and the air pollution in Beijing has been quantitatively analyzed in this paper. By using the grey relational model, the aim of this study is to explore how the socio-economic and human activities affect on the air pollution in the city of Beijing, China. Four air pollutants, as the particulate matter with size 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5), particulate matter with size 10 micrometers or less (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), are selected as the indicators of air pollution. Additionally, fifteen socio-economic indicators are selected to account for the regional socio-economic characteristics (economy variables, energy consumption variables, pollution emissions variables, environment and construction activity variables). The results highlight that all variables are associated with the concentrations of the four selected air pollutants, but with notable differences between the air pollutants. Most of the socio-economic indicators, such as industrial output, total energy consumption are highly correlated with PM2.5, while PM10, SO2, and NOx present in general moderate correlations with most of the socioeconomic variables. Contrary to other studies and reports this study reveals that vehicles and life energy do not have the strongest effect on air pollution in Beijing. This study provides useful information to reduce air pollution and support decision-making for sustainable development.', 'For the last few decades, air pollution in developing country like India is increasing, and it is a matter of huge concern due to its associated human health impacts. In this region, the burgeoning population, escalating urbanization and industrialization, has been cited as the major reason for such a high air pollution. The present study was carried out for health risk assessment of aerosol particles (PM10 and PM2.5) and its associated heavy metals of an agriculture farm site at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) considered to be green urban area in Delhi, India. The concentrations of both PM10 and PM2.5 varied significantly from 136 to 177 mu g/m(3) and 56 to 162 mu g/m(3), respectively at the site. In the present case, the highest PM10 and PM2.5 levels were reported in January, followed by December. The levels of ambient PM10 and PM2.5 are influenced by wind prevailing meteorology. These levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are more than the permissible limits of WHO guidelines of 15 and 5 mu g/m(3), respectively, thereby leading to high aerosol loadings specifically in winters. The PM concentration of the atmosphere was found to be negatively correlated with temperature during the sampling period. The concentrations of surface ozone O-3 and NOx in the present study were observed to be high in February and March, respectively. The increasing air pollution in the city of Delhi poses a great risk to the human health, as the particulate matter loaded with heavy metals can enter humans via different pathways, viz., ingestion, inhalation, and absorption through skin. The mean hazard index for metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, As, Cr, and Ni) was observed within the acceptable limit (HI < 1), thereby indicating negligible non-carcinogenic effects to residing population. The carcinogenic risk assessment was conducted for Cd, Pb, and As only, as the concentrations for other metals were found to be quite low. The carcinogenic risk values were also within the limits of USEPA standards, indicating no carcinogenic risks to the health of children and adults residing near the site. This information about the PM pollution at the agricultural site and health risk assessment will serve as a baseline data in assessment of human health impacts due to air pollution at the local scale and can be used for development of mitigation strategies for tackling air pollution.', ""This global study, which has been coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO/GAW) programme, aims to understand the behaviour of key air pollutant species during the COVID-19 pandemic period of exceptionally low emissions across the globe. We investigated the effects of the differences in both emissions and regional and local meteorology in 2020 compared with the period 2015-2019. By adopting a globally consistent approach, this comprehensive observational analysis focuses on changes in air quality in and around cities across the globe for the following air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, PMC (coarse fraction of PM), NO2, SO2, NOx, CO, O-3 and the total gaseous oxidant (O-X = NO2 + O-3) during the pre-lockdown, partial lockdown, full lockdown and two relaxation periods spanning from January to September 2020. The analysis is based on in situ ground-based air quality observations at over 540 traffic, background and rural stations, from 63 cities and covering 25 countries over seven geographical regions of the world. Anomalies in the air pollutant concentrations (increases or decreases during 2020 periods compared to equivalent 2015-2019 periods) were calculated and the possible effects of meteorological conditions were analysed by computing anomalies from ERA5 reanalyses and local observations for these periods. We observed a positive correlation between the reductions in NO2 and NOx concentrations and peoples' mobility for most cities. A correlation between PMC and mobility changes was also seen for some Asian and South American cities. A clear signal was not observed for other pollutants, suggesting that sources besides vehicular emissions also substantially contributed to the change in air quality. As a global and regional overview of the changes in ambient concentrations of key air quality species, we observed decreases of up to about 70% in mean NO2 and between 30% and 40% in mean PM2.5 concentrations over 2020 full lockdown compared to the same period in 2015-2019. However, PM2.5 exhibited complex signals, even within the same region, with increases in some Spanish cities, attributed mainly to the long-range transport of African dust and/or biomass burning (corroborated with the analysis of NO2/CO ratio). Some Chinese cities showed similar increases in PM2.5 during the lockdown periods, but in this case, it was likely due to secondary PM formation. Changes in O-3 concentrations were highly heterogeneous, with no overall change or small increases (as in the case of Europe), and positive anomalies of 25% and 30% in East Asia and South America, respectively, with Colombia showing the largest positive anomaly of similar to 70%. The SO2 anomalies were negative for 2020 compared to 2015-2019 (between similar to 25 to 60%) for all regions. For CO, negative anomalies were observed for all regions with the largest decrease for South America of up to similar to 40%. The NO2/CO ratio indicated that specific sites (such as those in Spanish cities) were affected by biomass burning plumes, which outweighed the NO2 decrease due to the general reduction in mobility (ratio of similar to 60%). Analysis of the total oxidant (OX = NO2 + O-3) showed that primary NO2 emissions at urban locations were greater than the O-3 production, whereas at background sites, O-X was mostly driven by the regional contributions rather than local NO2 and O-3 concentrations. The present study clearly highlights the importance of meteorology and episodic contributions (e.g., from dust, domestic, agricultural biomass burning and crop fertilizing) when analysing air quality in and around cities even during large emissions reductions. There is still the need to better understand how the chemical responses of secondary pollutants to emission change under complex meteorological conditions, along with climate change and socio-economic drivers may affect future air quality. The implications for regional and global policies are also significant, as our study clearly indicates that PM2.5 concentrations would not likely meet the World Health Organization guidelines in many parts of the world, despite the drastic reductions in mobility. Consequently, revisions of air quality regulation (e.g., the Gothenburg Protocol) with more ambitious targets that are specific to the different regions of the world may well be required.""]",NA,Air pollution,Health & well-being

Climate change is expected to exert substantial pressure on crop water supplies through increased rainfall variability and increased evaporative demand. The temporal and spatial variability of these climate change impacts, in combination with many feedbacks, at times operating at different scales, makes identifying specific, yet broadly applicable one-size-fits-all soil management solutions challenging. Adaptations that work well in one location may represent a poor management choice in another. Considering the local combinations of climate, soils, and crop production systems is fundamental for identifying appropriate strategies. Nonetheless, some broadly applicable soil management pathways for increasing soil water availability can be identified: (i) maximizing rainfall capture, (ii) maximizing soil water storage capacity (intensity x volume), and (iii) suppressing unproductive evaporative water losses, particularly during intervals when leaf area of the primary crop is low. Selecting climate, soil, and production-system-appropriate tillage and surface cover management practices is among the most relevant considerations for improving soil water availability. Maintaining surface cover favors evaporation suppression and increased capture of precipitation. Tillage choices affect internal soil water storage through impacts on soil properties that influence storage intensity and by altering the volume of soil available for root growth, as well as through effects on surface cover. Promoted management practices aimed at improving soil water availability for increased agricultural resiliency must be practically feasible and cost-effective in order to support their broad adoption, and such constraints should be an important consideration in their development.', 'Interactions between soil quality and climate change may influence the capacity of croplands to produce sufficient food. Here, we address this issue by using a new dataset of soil, climate and associated yield observations for 12,115 site-years representing 90% of total cereal production in China. Across crops and environmental conditions, we show that high-quality soils reduced the sensitivity of crop yield to climate variability leading to both higher mean crop yield (10.3 +/- 6.7%) and higher yield stability (decreasing variability by 15.6 +/- 14.4%). High-quality soils improve the outcome for yields under climate change by 1.7% (0.5-4.0%), compared to low-quality soils. Climate-driven yield change could result in reductions of national cereal production of 11.4 Mt annually under representative concentration pathway RCP 8.5 by 2080-2099. While this production reduction was exacerbated by 14% due to soil degradation, it can be reduced by 21% through soil improvement. This study emphasizes the vital role of soil quality in agriculture under climate change. Food demand is increasing, while climate change is impacting the magnitude and stability of crop yields. High-quality soils are able to buffer the negative impacts of climate change and lead to smaller yield reduction and higher yield stability, indicating a potential adaptation strategy.', ""In the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) region of South Asia cropping systems are predominantly rice-based and comprise rice and non-rice crops (e.g. maize, wheat, lentil, mungbean, jute) in rotation. There are large gaps between potential crop yields and those achieved in fanners' fields, primarily due to poor crop and soil management practices. Increasing climate variability and injudicious use of natural resources, particularly water and soil, mean that cropping systems have little resilience and are showing signs of being unsustainable. We hypothesized that replacing traditional crop rotations, grown under conventional tillage (CT) and with full residue removal, with crops grown under zero tillage (ZT) and with partial or full residue retention would improve both crop and cropping system yields, and reduce crop water demand, thus increasing the water productivity of cropping systems across the EGP. We evaluated four tillage-and-crop-establishment scenarios in three major cropping systems (rice-wheat, RW; rice-maize, RM; rice-lentil, RL) across eight districts of the EGP in 433 farmers' fields between 2015 and 2017. We compared farmers' traditional crop establishment practices (T1) against three scenarios based on the principles of conservation agriculture based sustainable intensification (CASI) and comprising a partial CAST option (T2: only non-rice crops grown under CASI management) and two full CASI options in which both crops were grown under CASI management; in T3 rice was direct seeded rice (DSR) and in T4 rice was transplanted without prior land preparation such as puddling (UPTR). Rice yields under all systems were not significantly different between CT (PTR) and CASI (ZTDSR and UTPR) but there was a significant yield gain of around 5% in both full and partial CASI on the yield of wheat and maize in the RW and RM systems. There were significant spatial trends in rice yields across all cropping systems. Total in-crop water (irrigation plus rainfall) usage was similar for the rainfed PTR, DSR and UTPR in all cropping systems as rice was primarily a rainfed crop grown during the wet season, however CASI practices reduced the required irrigation water, and thus the total in-crop water, to the dry season wheat or maize (but not to lentil) crops, compared to CT. This resulted in increased irrigation water productivity (greater than 27%) and total water productivity (greater than 26%) in both the wheat and maize crops. In the RW and RM systems irrigation water productivity was increased by over 25% and total water productivity by around 10%. These results indicate that the uptake of full or partial CASI practices, particularly in RM and RW systems, can lead to improvements in both cropping system and water productivity for smallholder farmers in the EGP.""]",NA,climate change,Food/agriculture

Coral reefs in the Central Indo-Pacific region comprise some of the most diverse and yet threatened marine habitats. While reef monitoring has grown throughout the region in recent years, studies of coral reef benthic cover remain limited in spatial and temporal scales. Here, we analysed 24,365 reef surveys performed over 37 years at 1972 sites throughout East Asia by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network using Bayesian approaches. Our results show that overall coral cover at surveyed reefs has not declined as suggested in previous studies and compared to reef regions like the Caribbean. Concurrently, macroalgal cover has not increased, with no indications of phase shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance on reefs. Yet, models incorporating socio-economic and environmental variables reveal negative associations of coral cover with coastal urbanisation and sea surface temperature. The diversity of reef assemblages may have mitigated cover declines thus far, but climate change could threaten reef resilience. We recommend prioritisation of regionally coordinated, locally collaborative long-term studies for better contextualisation of monitoring data and analyses, which are essential for achieving reef conservation goals.', 'The reduction in coral cover on many contemporary tropical reefs suggests a different set of coral community assemblages will dominate future reefs. To evaluate the capacity of reef corals to persist over various time scales, we examined coral community dynamics in contemporary, fossil, and simulated future coral reef ecosystems. Based on studies between 1987 and 2012 at two locations in the Caribbean, and between 1981 and 2013 at five locations in the Indo-Pacific, we show that many coral genera declined in abundance, some showed no change in abundance, and a few coral genera increased in abundance. Whether the abundance of a genus declined, increased, or was conserved, was independent of coral family. An analysis of fossil-reef communities in the Caribbean revealed changes in numerical dominance and relative abundances of coral genera, and demonstrated that neither dominance nor taxon was associated with persistence. As coral family was a poor predictor of performance on contemporary reefs, a trait-based, dynamic, multi-patch model was developed to explore the phenotypic basis of ecological performance in a warmer future. Sensitivity analyses revealed that upon exposure to thermal stress, thermal tolerance, growth rate, and longevity were the most important predictors of coral persistence. Together, our results underscore the high variation in the rates and direction of change in coral abundances on contemporary and fossil reefs. Given this variation, it remains possible that coral reefs will be populated by a subset of the present coral fauna in a future that is warmer than the recent past.', 'Coral reefs have emerged as one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to climate variation and change. While the contribution of a warming climate to the loss of live coral cover has been well documented across large spatial and temporal scales, the associated effects on fish have not. Here, we respond to recent and repeated calls to assess the importance of local management in conserving coral reefs in the context of global climate change. Such information is important, as coral reef fish assemblages are the most species dense vertebrate communities on earth, contributing critical ecosystem functions and providing crucial ecosystem services to human societies in tropical countries. Our assessment of the impacts of the 1998 mass bleaching event on coral cover, reef structural complexity, and reef associated fishes spans 7 countries, 66 sites and 26 degrees of latitude in the Indian Ocean. Using Bayesian meta-analysis we show that changes in the size structure, diversity and trophic composition of the reef fish community have followed coral declines. Although the ocean scale integrity of these coral reef ecosystems has been lost, it is positive to see the effects are spatially variable at multiple scales, with impacts and vulnerability affected by geography but not management regime. Existing no-take marine protected areas still support high biomass of fish, however they had no positive affect on the ecosystem response to large-scale disturbance. This suggests a need for future conservation and management efforts to identify and protect regional refugia, which should be integrated into existing management frameworks and combined with policies to improve system-wide resilience to climate variation and change.']",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

Climate smart agriculture approaches have been adopted in many countries around the world to address the adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural production. There is limited information about climate smart agriculture adoption by peri-urban farmers in developing countries. The present study aimed to assess the extent to which agricultural activities by smallholder crop farmers in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng province of South Africa are climate smart, and to establish the sustainable measures to be put in place to enhance the adoption of climate smart agriculture. The study made use of a mixed method design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. A combination of simple random and non-probability sampling techniques was employed to select the study locations and identify respondents. A sample of thirty-six farmers were selected for the study. The main findings revealed overwhelming awareness of climate change and the impacts thereof on crop productivity and yields. However, the respondents' level of awareness of climate smart agriculture technologies was generally low. Despite the lack of knowledge of climate smart agriculture practices, the farmers were, to an extent, utilizing adaptation mechanisms acquired from indigenous systems or scientific knowledge. Examples of these practices include mulching, cover cropping, crop rotation and use of crop varieties. The study concludes that much more can be done to scale up the uptake of climate smart agriculture in the Gauteng province.

The multistage stratified-random sampling method was used to select 480 farmers from the four rice districts of the region, and data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression and contingency tables are used to analyze the determinants of farmers' adopted strategies and adaptation extent (number of adopted strategies). Results show that farmers perceived significant changes in the climate, including the rise in average summer and winter temperatures and the decline in overall precipitation. The study further found that farmers' adopted adaptation strategies include supplementary irrigation, adjustments in rice cultivation dates, crop diversification, use of climate-smart varieties, better fertilizer management, and farm resizing. Logit model showed that farmers' age, primary occupation, income, landholding, access to irrigation, credit, climate information, and farm advisory appeared to be the significant determinants of their adaptation decision. The adaptation extent strongly correlates with farmers' education and access to climate information and credit services. Based on these findings, this study suggests the relevant institutions improve farmers' access to irrigation water, credit, farm advisory, and climate information to improve their adaptation extent and hence resilience of the rice-farming system.""]",NA,climate change,Food/agriculture

The presented framework can be applied for all renewable energy technologies and infrastructure in both urban and rural areas and allows to attain a decision acceptable to the local community.', ""Climate change and extreme weather events impose urgent necessities on distributed energy systems with energy flexibility and resilience to survive the district power supply systems. Compared to centralized energy systems, distributed energy systems show more superiorities in power shifting, fast demand response, regional energy allocations, and so on. However, electrification transformation- enabled flexible energy sharing, smart energy integration, and advanced management are still in their infancy stages, with unsolved but urgent issues, like large-scale energy system planning and optimization, energy trading and pricing mechanisms, so on. In this study, energy-sharing economy with renewable integration and management in communities has been comprehensively reviewed. The source-grid-load-storage framework has been implemented on district energy systems with complex relationships among the energy supply-storage-transmission-distribution chain. Roles of energy sharing, integration, and management on energy system sustainability have been provided. Considering widely installed large-scale renewable energy systems, planning and optimization platforms and tools are provided to guide the distributed/centralized system planning and accurate capacity sizing. Results showed that, multi-directional power interactions with electrification in buildings and E-mobility spatiotemporal energy sharing and smart grids enable high renewable penetration, fast power response, energy supply reliability, etc. Unlike traditional fossil fuel-based power plants, distributed renewable-supported energy systems (like BIPVs, electric vehicles, etc.) enable emerging energy sharing, integration, and management for energy flexibility and resilience with fast response and energy survivals. Roles of advanced energy include power shifting, fast demand response, regional energy allocations, and so on. Electricity market liberalization can incentivize multi-stakeholders' proactivity and market vitality for distributed renewable energy spatiotemporal microgrids. Dynamic energy pricing for the shared power is dependent on the supply-demand relationship, and cost-benefit allocations among different stakeholders need to be investigated for justice and fairness. To avoid performance over or underestimations, advanced approaches are highly necessary for large-scale energy system planning and optimization. Research results can pave paths for upcoming studies in urban energy system planning, design, and optimization with high energy efficiency and low carbon emissions through joint collaborations from highly economically incentivized participators.

Despite the DMP's salient interventions proffered by various urban actors and government institutions, the city experienced the worst sporadic flood events between 2019 and 2020. This paper interrogates the ineffectiveness of Kampala's flood policy in managing emerging and future flood risks with respect to flood management interventions and stakeholder involvement. Specifically, this research reconciles institutional practices in mitigating flood risks and further interrogates multiple forms of flood risk knowledge that inform flood risk policy. The study draws on multiple qualitative methods such as semi-structured expert interviews, a web-based survey and document review to better understand institutional responses to flooding and the role of urban actors and institutions. The findings reveal that Kampala's recent governance rearrangements led to an increased financial benefit that redefined drainage infrastructure. However, the drainage improvement initiatives have not significantly improved flood risk management due to a shift in institutional priorities, changing flood risk drivers, political interference and uncoordinated flood risk interventions among stakeholders. The paper calls for a rethink of the role of governmental-urban actors' engagements and coordination to enable effective flood risk policy formulation."", ""Flooding is the most common natural hazard and third most damaging globally after storms and earthquakes. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase flood risk through more frequent heavy precipitation, increased catchment wetness and sea level rise. This paper reviews steps being taken by actors at international, national, regional and community levels to adapt to flood risk from tidal, fluvial, surface and groundwater sources. We refer to existing inventories, national and sectoral adaptation plans, flood inquiries, building and planning codes, city plans, research literature and international policy reviews. We distinguish between the enabling environment for adaptation and specific implementing measures to manage flood risk. Enabling includes routine monitoring, flood forecasting, data exchange, institutional reform, bridging organizations, contingency planning for disasters, insurance and legal incentives to reduce vulnerability. All such activities are 'low regret' in that they yield benefits regardless of the climate scenario but are not cost-free. Implementing includes climate safety factors for new build, upgrading resistance and resilience of existing infrastructure, modifying operating rules, development control, flood forecasting, temporary and permanent retreat from hazardous areas, periodic review and adaptive management. We identify evidence of both types of adaptation following the catastrophic 2010/11 flooding in Victoria, Australia. However, significant challenges remain for managing transboundary flood risk (at all scales), protecting existing property at risk from flooding, and ensuring equitable outcomes in terms of risk reduction for all. Adaptive management also raises questions about the wider preparedness of society to systematically monitor and respond to evolving flood risks and vulnerabilities."", 'Increasing flood risk due to rapid urbanization and climate change calls for improved integration between flood risk management and spatial planning processes to enhance the resilience of cities, including in Egypt. Although much work has been conducted on flood impact in Egypt, the gap in integrating flood risk assessment with spatial planning practices has not been discussed in academia. In practice, flood risk assessment is not mandatory for local-level spatial planning projects in Egypt, resulting in increased flood risk. This study examines the causes of this gap and proposes possible solutions that increase flood resiliency. A mixed-method approach was utilized based on a questionnaire survey with local stakeholders in academic and professional categories. The results reveal reasons for the gap, including issues related to the realization of the role of spatial planning in flood risk reduction, lack of coordination between the authorities responsible for developing the flood hazard maps and the spatial planning authority, availability and accessibility of the required data, and subjectivity of conducted flood analyses. Four key recommendations pertain to building an operational framework for integrating flood risk assessment in spatial planning, improving stakeholder awareness and collaboration, strengthening risk communication, and improving both quality and access to data. These measures will help to overcome the identified difficulties and enhance the integration between spatial planning and flood risk assessment, effectively increasing their flood resilience.']",NA,Flooding,Governance

Critical risk determination method is useful to the system risk prevention and adaptive strategy formulation. Based on analyzing the failure mechanism of power supply under heat wave impact, the paper put forward the method framework of energy-flow network on electric power system risk evaluation. There are three parts in the framework including energy-flow chart analysis of power supply and consumption, establishment and network analysis of Gephi visualization network, and matrix diagram evaluation of node importance. The visualized network of power system with different years and electricity input from external area were established and compared in the case study of Beijing in China. The analysis results showed that the network structure stability of the power system decreased slightly, which was due to the node energy flow becoming high imbalance such as power input from external area, local power generation and energy consumption. For risk prevention, power infrastructures should focus on the high-voltage transmission and distribution facilities and 500 kV hub substations. Meanwhile, to electric power generation and supply, natural gas supply and power supply from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region played the key roles. And power consumption should focus on the tertiary industry and living consumption.', 'The occurrence of large-scale outages in power distribution systems (PDSs) caused, for instance, by extreme weather events has raised concerns on the cascading impact of the power outages on the resilience of other critical infrastructures, including water distribution systems (WDSs), whose healthy operation highly relies on the availability of power from PDSs. This paper proposes an analytics model for quantifying the interdependence between the resilience of power and water distribution systems. The proposed model first performs spatio-temporal outage analysis on the PDS and WDS to determine the PDS power serving capability and the resulting cascading impact on the WDS water serving capability during the occurrence of disruptions. The resilience interdependence is then determined by a proposed set of six metrics calculated using the power and water serving capability profiles, which trace and quantify the cascading impacts of power outages in the operation of WDSs during the degradation and recovery stages. The proposed analytics model is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus power distribution system supplying power for pumping stations of a 15-node test WDS, considering multiple cases of water storage capacity, single and multiple outage scenarios, and availability of distributed generation. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed metrics track the temporal and spatial interdependence between the resilience of power and water distribution systems, providing a mechanism to identify weak spots, and assess options to enhance the resilience of the critical water infrastructure.', 'The efficient, reliable, and resilient supply of electricity has become essential for social and economic well-being of the modern society.

This paper proposes an equity-aware power distribution system restoration model in an effort to ensure a more equitable yet resilient power distribution operation after outages. To this end, the proposed equity-aware distribution system restoration model balances the efficiency of the restoration operation and the equitable allocation of distributed energy resources among affected customers after an outage, while prioritizing the critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to ensure a more equitable restoration process as measured by the proposed fairness and restoration performance indices.

Among these approaches, green-grey-blue coupling measures have emerged as one of the prominent technical solutions. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of blue-green infrastructure and integrated green-grey-blue systems in mitigating flood disasters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of green-grey-blue infrastructure in enhancing urban flood resilience remains insufficient. This paper proposes an improved global resilience analysis (GRA) method to quantify the effectiveness of green-greyblue infrastructure in flood resilience and the feedback relationships between influencing factors. The method offers a way to quantify the backwater effect of blue infrastructure in conditions where hydrological and hydraulic models cannot efficiently simulate the situation, by introducing the Potential Flooding Area Ratio (PFAR). The effectiveness of this method was further demonstrated in a typical watershed in Wuhan, China. The results show that green infrastructure is sufficient to handle rainfall with a return period of 5 years, with Low Impact Development (LID) facilities (green roof, permeable pavement and rain garden) outperforming Natural Green Space (NGS), but the difference decreases with increasing rain intensity. While the extension of the rainfall return period exacerbates urban flooding, even under the precipitation scenario associated with a 1,000-year return period, increasing pipe diameter can significantly enhance the flood resilience of grey infrastructure. The potential contribution of blue infrastructure to flood resilience is considerable, and optimized regulation schemes for the pre-flood water levels can enhance the adaptability of the system. It is worth noting that ignoring the backwater effect can lead to an overestimation of flood resilience assessment by up to 104 %, therefore, the introduction of PFAR has improved the accuracy of the assessment method by considering the convenience and efficiency of the model. The introduced backwater effect index incorporates the flooded area into the failure mode, filling the gap of traditional GRA method that only considers the flood volume and time, to help quantify the structural impact of green-grey-blue system on flood resilience.', ""To mitigate the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on hydrology and water quality, the new concept of urban stormwater management, sponge city, has been proposed to increase the city's resilience. Although 30 cities in China have been chosen to implement sponge city construction, there is a lack of a quantitative evaluation method to help decision makers select resilience and sustainability schemes. This paper proposes a new integrated framework in selecting the resilient and sustainable sponge city design schemes. The developed framework consists of the following 10 indicators: resilience, flood volume, flood duration time, hydraulic performance index, annual runoff volume control, rainfall usage, pollution control, social acceptability, greenhouse gas emission, and cost. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to simulate the rainfall-runoff process to calculate the indicators. The multi-criteria analysis methods of the improved AHP were used to calculate the weights of indictors, while the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to rank the design schemes. The proposed framework was then applied to Xining, China, as a case study. The performances of three sponge city design schemes (51, S2, and S3) with different sponge city construction areas and different low impact development (LID) controls were analyzed for the LID construction project. The results identified 51 as the best scheme where 50% permeable pavement and 30% rain barrel are implemented in residential areas. In contrast, S3 had the lowest scores, with the largest LID construction area. This integrated framework will assist policy-makers in the selection of optimal sponge city design schemes."", 'In recent years, Sponge City has gained significant interests as a way of urban water management. The kernel of Sponge City is to develop a coupled green-grey-blue system which consists of green infrastructure at the source, grey infrastructure (i.e. drainage system) at the midway and receiving water bodies as the blue part at the terminal. However, the current approaches for assessing the performance of Sponge City construction are confined to green-grey systems and do not adequately reflect the effectiveness in runoff reduction and the impacts on receiving water bodies. This paper proposes an integrated assessment framework of coupled green-grey-blue systems on compliance of water quantity and quality control targets in Sponge City construction. Rainfall runoff and river system models are coupled to provide quantitative simulation evaluations of a number of indicators of land-based and river quality. A multi-criteria decision-making method, i.e., Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is adopted to rank design alternatives and identify the optimal alternative for Sponge City construction. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated in a typical plain river network area of Suzhou, China. The results demonstrate that the performance of Sponge City strategies increases with large scale deployment under smaller rainfall events. In addition, though surface runoff has a dilution effect on the river water quality, the control of surface pollutants can play a significant role in the river water quality improvement. This framework can be applied to Sponge City projects to achieve the enhancement of urban water management.']",NA,Flooding,Ecosystems

In recent years, disaster management has become a key issue for the sustainable development of a society. In this regard, understanding how people perceive disasters is needed to formulate better disaster management strategies and enhance the resilience of the society. This research seeks to study risk perception and relevant attitudes, which are the fundamental factors of human behavior under the threat of disaster impact. A stated preference survey is conducted to investigate people's willingness to pay for earthquake risk reduction, where the effect of information is also the concern and incorporated in survey design. Thereupon, a multiple-bounded dichotomous choice model and an ordered probit model are estimated to quantify risk attitudes toward earthquakes as the monetary value. Results suggest that factors, such as higher socioeconomic status, more family members, and the residence aged above 40 years old, have positive effects on risk perception. In addition, presenting previous earthquake disaster damage information may increase individuals' risk perception. The prospect theory is employed in the study to establish a theoretical model to capture people's risk-seeking and/or risk-averse behavior, thereby more sophisticatedly reflecting the behavioral realism related to disaster preparedness.

In Myanmar, with its frequent natural hazards like floods, cyclones and droughts and its high probability of earthquakes, raising awareness of and preparedness for disasters is of eminent importance in order to increase the resilience of society, households and individuals. Disaster research shows that the awareness and perception of people regarding disasters and thus also their risk preparedness can vary substantially. This seems to stem from various sources: the socio-demographic characteristics of households and people as well as former experiences of disaster seem to play a crucial role. Information of such variables and understanding how they influence the disaster risk perception and preparedness of households and people can provide an important background against which to improve individual disaster risk awareness and preparedness - with the final aim of making society, households and individuals more resilient. In this paper, the results of a household survey carried out in eight townships of Yangon (Myanmar) are presented. The analysis investigates how socio-demographic characteristics and the previous experiences of disaster of the respondents and their households influence their disaster risk perception and preparedness in different areas of Yangon City. The results show strong differences in disaster risk perception and preparedness according to socio-demographic characteristics and previous experiences of disaster in different areas of Yangon City. Finally, the findings feed into and inform about successful disaster management.', 'Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the preparedness of disaster mitigation agency officers in both urban and rural areas as high vulnerability zones in Aceh, Indonesia, in dealing with disasters. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study adopted a conceptual framework from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and United Nations of Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)/International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) (LIPI-UNESCO/ISDR, 2006), explaining the study of community preparedness in anticipating earthquake and tsunami disasters. The framework of the study consists of five disaster preparedness parameters, namely, knowledge and attitude to face disasters, policies and guidelines, emergency response plans, disaster early warning systems and mobilization of resources. This conceptual framework was developed after the 2004 tsunami through an analysis study in the three provinces in Indonesia (Aceh, Padang and Bengkulu) experiencing earthquakes and tsunamis. This conceptual framework serves as a guideline and is in line with the objective of the regional disaster management Agency to reduce disaster risk through increasing community preparedness, especially providers or officers in anticipating disasters. Findings There was a significant difference in disaster preparedness among officers from the urban and rural areas. The area size, location accessibility, the communication network and disaster detection and warning facilities could associate with the results. Research limitations/implications The respondents were selected from only two districts in Aceh Province, Indonesia, which are vulnerable to disasters. The study only identifies the disaster preparedness among disaster management agency officers (DMAOs) adopted from LIPI-UNESCO/ISDR about community preparedness in anticipating disasters particularly tsunami and earthquake. Therefore, the results of this study may have limited generalizability to other areas in Indonesia and beyond. Practical implications The results of this study could possibly serve as recommendations for policymakers and disaster management agencies, particularly in rural areas to prepare contingency plans that involve both internal and external institutions to arrange the regulations related to community-based emergency response plans and disaster early warning systems. Such programs of education, training and disaster drill needed to be in place and conducted regularly for the officers in a rural area. Finally, the other sub-scales showed no difference in disaster preparedness, however, collaboration and support to each other in disaster risk reduction plan by improving the capacity building, policy enhancement and disaster management guidelines are required. Also, attempts to optimize logistics adequacy, budget allocations and disaster preparedness education and training for both DMAOs are strongly recommended through the lens of the study. The results of the study might useful for further research that could be developed based on this current study. Originality/value The emergency response plans and disaster early warning systems were significantly different between the rural and urban officers in disaster preparedness. Attending disaster management programs, experiences in responding to disasters and the availability of facilities and funds could be considered in ascertaining the preparedness of officers to deal with disasters.']",NA,disaster,Behavioural/cultural

The destructive effects of floods are magnified in cities. Accurate models of urban flood susceptibility are required to mitigate this hazard mitigation and build resilience in cities. In this paper, we evaluate flood riskin Jiroft city, Iran, using a combination of machine learning and decision-making methods. Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding. These results show that flood risk mapping provide insights for priority planning in flood risk management, especially in areas with limited hydrological data.', 'Flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards that has caused catastrophic effects worldwide. Recently, machine learning methods have become widespread in flood susceptibility assessments due to their efficiency and robustness. However, flood inventory data acquired from historical flooding records and field surveys in existing studies are sparse and not enough to develop accurate machine learning models. Thus, we developed a hybrid approach that integrates hydrodynamic model (HEC-HMS/RAS), rapid flood model (height above the nearest drainage, HAND) and machine learning model (random forest, RF) for flood susceptibility assessment. The proposed approach was then implemented in the Xinluo watershed, a flood-prone mountainous catchment in China. The results showed that the spatially continuous flood inventory map generated from HEC-HMS/RAS model satisfies the big data requirements of the RF model, and the proposed hybrid approach demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in flood susceptibility assessment with overall accuracy and area under the ROC curve values of 0.915 and 0.912, respectively. The geographical and hydromorphological factors had greater effects on riverine flooding with average contribution of 27.8% and 27.6%. In comparison, the average contri-bution of land cover and meteorological factors were 24.3% and 20.3%, respectively. The method proposed in this study is effective in assessing and forecasting flood susceptibility and can facilitate resilience planning as well as integrated flood management.', 'Floods have become increasingly frequent and devastating in recent decades, posing unignorable risks as highly destructive natural hazards. To effectively manage and mitigate these risks, accurate flood hazard mapping is crucial. Machine learning models have emerged as valuable approaches for flood hazard assessment. In this study, six machine learning (ML) models, including Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron, and Naive Bayes, were utilized to evaluate urban flood hazard in Zaio, NE Morocco, and estimate the flood presence extent. Nine flood conditioning factors were used as input variables. Historical flood presence and absence data were employed for models training and testing, incorporating 663 flood presence and absence locations dating back to past flood events. Performance evaluation metrics such as Kappa statistic, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each model. RF (AUC = 0.92) and XGB (AUC = 0.9) models showed excellent classification capabilities, surpassing the performance of the other models, while the other models exhibited lower but recognizable performances. Additionally, the hazard presence extent maps generated by the ML models exhibited a decent alignment with a historical flood event maps created by the hydrodynamic and the cellular automata models. The results imply that ML models offer effective solutions for mapping urban flood hazards. The innovative integration of various ensemble and single ML models demonstrates their potential in urban flood hazard susceptibility and extent mapping, effectively surpassing the limitations associated with limited availability of hydrologic/hydraulic data and computational burden. These mapped results can be instrumental for local authorities in shaping mitigation strategies in the city of Zaio.']",NA,Flooding,Technological

Traditional disaster management approaches are inadequate for addressing these challenges; thus, the concept of resilience has gradually been integrated into disaster management strategies. This study addresses this gap by developing a semi-quantitative evaluation framework for flood resilience on a large, regional scale. This framework combines the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model with a dynamic representation of flood resilience processes, incorporating pre-disaster resistance, during-disaster absorption, and post-disaster recovery. A comprehensive regional flood resilience index system (RFRI) is constructed to provide a holistic assessment of flood resilience throughout the disaster cycle. This study quantified flood resilience and utilized Geographic Information System spatial analysis to evaluate the spatial patterns of flood resilience at the municipal level. The evaluation framework was applied to a real flood disaster that affected five southern provinces of China in 2022. The results indicate that: (1) The overall flood resilience levels in the five southern provinces were relatively low, with only 6% of the units having a Flood Resilience Index (FRI) exceeding 0.6; and (2) in terms of pre-disaster resistance, 74% of municipalities in the five southern provinces of China exhibited a moderate or higher level of resilience. However, the overall performance of these provinces is relatively poor in terms of absorption during disasters and post-disaster recovery; (3) The development of flood resilience systems in the five provinces was severely imbalanced, with only two municipal-level cities having an FRI above 0.8, both of which are located in Guangdong Province. The evaluation framework established in this study enables rapid and accurate quantitative assessment of flood resilience at the municipal level. It aids in identifying deficiencies in the flood resilience systems of various regions, thereby strengthening efforts to build flood resilience.', 'Urban floods have become increasingly frequent in recent years, highlighting the need for resilience evaluation and the identification of strategies to improve urban flood resilience. In this study, a system of resilience evaluation indicators is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the level of urban flood resilience. The entropy method used to calculate the resilience index and the space-time permutation scan method used to analyze the space-time aggregation characteristics of urban resilience levels are combined to establish a methodology for evaluating urban flood resilience. An evaluation indicator system for urban flood resilience is proposed, encompassing aspects of natural, economy, society, and infrastructure. This system attuned to the local needs of urban flood resilience evaluation, tests the applicability of the Guide for Safety Resilient City Evaluation (GB/T 40947-2021) in this study. Moreover, it incorporates key common indicators extracted from prior studies on urban flood resilience evaluation. Zhejiang Province, a flood-prone area in China, is selected as the study area, and the proposed evaluation indicator system is used to evaluate the urban flood resilience levels in Zhejiang and their space-time trends from 2011 to 2020. The results show that resilience levels have improved in the natural, economic, and infrastructure aspects, while the resilience levels of social aspect remain high. From 2011 to 2014, two distinct aggregation patterns emerged, delineated as inland-type and coastal-type aggregation areas. An analysis of both patterns was conducted, considering an array of influencing indicators, such as green coverage rate in built-up areas, population age structure index, gross domestic product, density of resident population in built-up areas, and per capita disposable income. The period from 2014 to 2020, however, did not reveal any significant aggregation characteristics.

The framework has been applied to Yangtze River Delta (YRD) consisting 27 cities in China. Following a rigorous analysis, the cities are ranked and mapped, among which Nanjing stands out to be the first, whereas the entire region presents a moderate level of urban flood resilience varying from city to city. The detailed comparison with sensitivity analysis of resilience at regional, provincial and city level suggests a better resilience in pre-flood stage than post-flood stage. Finally, practical recommendations to regional and local level are provided for further flood mitigation and resilience improvement. The proposed framework is generalizable and useful to develop flood related standards, establish benchmarks, perform evaluation at regional, provincial and city levels across China and other parts of the world.']",NA,Flooding,Technological

To maximize the associated benefits of urban trees in a given city or neighborhood, it is important that the canopy of newly planted trees matches or exceeds the canopy of the trees that are lost. However, cities often use cross-sectional data to make decisions about the number of trees that should be planted without considering an individual tree's growth and life span. In this study, individual tree growth and longevity data were used to portray the current and future conditions of street trees in six neighborhoods near Downtown Los Angeles and to identify locations in those neighborhoods that are in urgent need of interventions for tree planting. The results of this study indicate that, under the typical tree mortality scenario, near half of the current tree canopy will disappear by 2050, and on average, approximately one percent of the existing street trees will be lost due to aging each year. The approach used in this study shows how cities can monitor the age and mortality rate of the urban tree canopy over time. This approach informs tree planting campaigns that will preserve the long-term vitality and size of urban tree canopies and contribute to the resiliency of cities in a warmer future climate."", 'The urban environment characterized by various stresses poses challenges to trees. In particular, water deficits and high temperatures can cause immense drought stress to urban trees, resulting in reduced growth and die-off. Drought-tolerant species are expected to be resilient to these conditions and are therefore advantageous over other, more susceptible species. However, the drought tolerance of urban trees in relation to the specific growth conditions in urban areas remains poorly researched. This study aimed to analyze the annual growth and drought tolerance of two common urban tree species, namely small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill. (T. cordata)) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L. (R. pseudoacacia)), in two cities in southern Germany in relation to their urban growing conditions. Marked growth reductions during drought periods and subsequent fast recovery were found for R. pseudoacacia, whereas T. cordata exhibited continued reduced growth after a drought event, although these results were highly specific to the analyzed city. We further show that individual tree characteristics and environmental conditions significantly influence the growth of urban trees. Canopy openness and other aspects of the surrounding environment (water supply and open surface area of the tree pit), tree size, and tree species significantly affect urban tree growth and can modify the ability of trees to tolerate the drought stress in urban areas. Sustainable tree planting of well adapted tree species to their urban environment ensures healthy trees providing ecosystem services for a high quality of life in cities.', 'Urban forests are recognized for their multiple benefits to society, and increasingly so with climate change. However, they too are threatened by increased heat, pollution, and higher risks of pest outbreaks. Increasing the diversity of tree species in urban forests is crucial for enhancing their resilience by reducing the risk of mass tree losses. Yet, we lack the most important ingredient to act: knowledge. Traditionally, urban tree inventories only include trees on public land. This study describes the first urban forest research plot established in Montreal, Canada, encompassing 1567 trees on public and private (residential and institutional) lands from 84 species and 43 genera. Our paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing empirical data that enhances our understanding and provides a clearer picture of urban forests, particularly concerning total tree diversity, across public and private lands. We found that tree abundance and diversity differed depending on land ownership: the public urban forest included more trees and was slightly more diverse than the private urban forest. Acer emerged as the most abundant genus, and small trees dominated all ownership categories. Importantly, the species composition of trees in public and private spaces differed, increasing the overall diversity.

Recent research emphasizes a need for a greater understanding of community disaster response and recovery capacity so that communities can absorb shocks and withstand severe conditions and progress through the recovery period more efficiently. Nepal, which is prone to a multitude of hazards and having recently experienced a large earthquake in 2015, provides a unique opportunity for exploring disaster resilience in the developing world context. To date, no study investigating community disaster resilience across the entire country of Nepal exists. This study quantifies disaster resilience at Nepal's village level, primarily using census data. Guided by the Disaster Resilience of Place (DROP) model, 22 variables were selected as indicators of social, economic, community, infrastructure, and environmental resilience. Community resilience was assessed for 3971 village development communities (VDCs) and municipalities while using a principal component analysis. Additionally, a cluster analysis was performed to distinguish spatial patterns of resilience. Analyses reveal differential community disaster resilience across the country. Communities in the capital city Kathmandu and in the western and far western Hill are relatively resilient. While the entire Tarai region, which holds the greatest proportion of Nepal's population, exhibits relatively low levels of resilience when compared to the rest of the county. The results from this analysis provide empirical evidence with the potential to help decision-makers in the allocation of scarce resources to increase resilience at the local level."", ""Flash floods have recently become a recurrent phenomenon with devastating impacts on different cities, particularly vulnerable communities in Iran. Community resilience is a relatively recent approach to resilience, increasingly used in the natural hazards and climate change literature. This study aims to assess the community resilience of a flood-prone district, the Saadi neighborhood, in Shiraz, Iran. Based on an extensive literature review, an indicator-based framework was outlined to measure community resilience to flash floods using five dimensions: social, community capital, economic, institutional, and infrastructural and housing resilience. The primary data on community flood resilience assessment was collected through a survey using questionnaires. Using simple random sampling, 374 individuals from the residents of the study area were selected. The data were ranked and analyzed through qualification methods, descriptive statistics and expert panel weighting system. The overall composite community resilience and the community resilience indices' scores were .56 out of 1 for the selected community, indicating a moderate level of resilience. The findings showed that institutional and infrastructure/housing conditions had a limited impact on community resilience. However, social trust and community capital were crucial for aiding the community's rapid recovery from a flood disaster and preparing for future floods. Policymakers and resilience planners, thus, should focus on the lessons that can be learnt from the past floods, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional resilience, as these have a significant impact on the overall resilience of local communities."", 'Measurement and development of resilience are essential in disaster risk reduction programs. Furthermore, efforts are needed to measure resilience baselines to track changes over time and compare areas for monitoring and evaluating resilience development. Therefore, this study identified dimensions and indicators for measuring resilience using a statistical approach and developed an index-based spatial resilience model in a web-GIS environment. This paper presents the spatial distribution of urban resilience to disasters in Semarang City at the sub-district level. Factor analysis showed that 21 selected indicators could represent five dimensions of resilience: social, economic, infrastructure, environmental, and institutional. Furthermore, the model results showed that 88% of the sub-districts were in the moderate resilience class. The spatial distribution of each dimension showed considerable heterogeneity in its coastal and plain areas (city center) as well as better resilience in the social and infrastructure dimensions than in its hilly areas. The hilly areas in the west have relatively better resilience than those in the east. These results can be used as a reference in managing resilience to disasters. The model presents a spatial distribution of resilience based on an index that quickly provides an overview of the conditions and determines priorities for increasing resilience in supporting disaster risk reduction programs.']",NA,disaster,Community

Traumatic events often lead to increased mental health burdens in affected communities. Objective To assess if the number of traumatic events experienced by residents of Fort McMurray correlates with the prevalence and severity of mental health issues experienced. Methodology A cross-sectional study using an online survey questionnaire was used to gather demographic, trauma (wildfire, flooding, and COVID-19), and clinical information from the resident of Fort McMurray between April 24 to June 2 2021. Likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and low resilience were measured using standardised rating scales. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 26 using Chi-Square tests and multivariate regression analysis. Results Respondents who experienced COVID-19 and either flood or wildfire traumas (N = 101) were eleven times more likely to have GAD symptoms (OR: 11.39; 95% CI: 1.43-91.04), four times more likely to have likely MDD, (OR: 3.85; 95% CI: .995-14.90), ten times more likely to have likely PTSD (OR: 10.47; 95% CI: 1.28-85.67), and low resilience (OR: 10.56; 95% CI: 1.21-92.17). Respondents who experienced COVID-19, flooding, and wildfire traumas (N = 47) were eighteen times more likely to express GAD symptoms (OR: 18.30; 95% CI: 2.20-152.45) and more than eleven times likely to have likely PTSD (OR: 11.41; 95% CI: 1.34-97.37) in comparison to the respondents who experienced COVID-19 only trauma (N = 19). Conclusion Measures to reduce climate change and associated natural disasters could reduce the impact of cumulative trauma and associated mental health burden in vulnerable populations. It is essential that more mental health resources are mobilised to support communities impacted by multiple natural disasters.', ""Background: Only very few studies have investigated the geographic distribution of psychological resilience and associated mental health outcomes after natural or man made disasters. Such information is crucial for location-based interventions that aim to promote recovery in the aftermath of disasters. The purpose of this study therefore was to investigate geographic variability of (1) posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depression in a Hurricane Sandy affected population in NYC and (2) psychological vulnerability and resilience factors among affected areas in NYC boroughs. Methods: Cross-sectional telephone survey data were collected 13 to 16 months post-disaster from household residents (N=418 adults) in NYC communities that were most heavily affected by the hurricane. The Posttraumatic Stress Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was applied for measuring posttraumatic stress and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used for measuring depression. We applied spatial autocorrelation and spatial regimes regression analyses, to test for spatial clusters of mental health outcomes and to explore whether associations between vulnerability and resilience factors and mental health differed among New York City's five boroughs. Results: Mental health problems clustered predominantly in neighborhoods that are geographically more exposed towards the ocean indicating a spatial variation of risk within and across the boroughs. We further found significant variation in associations between vulnerability and resilience factors and mental health. Race/ethnicity (being Asian or non-Hispanic black) and disaster-related stressors were vulnerability factors for mental health symptoms in Queens, and being employed and married were resilience factors for these symptoms in Manhattan and Staten Island. In addition, parental status was a vulnerability factor in Brooklyn and a resilience factor in the Bronx. Conclusions: We conclude that explanatory characteristics may manifest as psychological vulnerability and resilience factors differently across different regional contexts. Our spatial epidemiological approach is transferable to other regions around the globe and, in the light of a changing climate, could be used to strengthen the psychosocial resources of demographic groups at greatest risk of adverse outcomes pre-disaster. In the aftermath of a disaster, the approach can be used to identify survivors at greatest risk and to plan for targeted interventions to reach them."", 'In Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, the wildfire of May 2016 forced the population of 88,000 to rapidly evacuate in a traumatic and chaotic manner. Ten percentage of the homes in the city were destroyed, and many more structures were damaged. Since youth are particularly vulnerable to negative effects of natural disasters, we examined possible long-term psychological impacts. To assess this, we partnered with Fort McMurray Public and Catholic Schools, who surveyed Grade 7-12 students (aged 11-19) in November 2017, 2018, and 2019-i.e., at 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years after the wildfire. The survey included validated measurement scales for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, drug use, alcohol use, tobacco use, quality of life, self-esteem, and resilience. Data analysis was done on large-scale anonymous surveys including 3,070 samples in 2017; 3,265 samples in 2018; and 3,041 samples in 2019. The results were unexpected and showed that all mental health symptoms increased from 2017 to 2019, with the exception of tobacco use. Consistent with this pattern, self-esteem and quality of life scores decreased. Resilience scores did not change significantly. Thus, mental health measures worsened, in contrast to our initial hypothesis that they would improve over time. Of note, we observed higher levels of mental health distress among older students, in females compared to male students, and in individuals with a minority gender identity, including transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals. These findings demonstrate that deleterious mental health effects can persist in youth for years following a wildfire disaster. This highlights the need for multi-year mental health support programs for youth in post-disaster situations. The indication that multi-year, post-disaster support is warranted is relatively novel, although not unknown. There is a need to systematically investigate factors associated with youth recovery following a wildfire disaster, as well as efficacy of psychosocial strategies during later phases of disaster recovery relative to early post-disaster interventions.']",NA,disaster,Health & well-being

Thus, this study represents a comprehensive investigation into food system studies and their impacts on achieving a sustainable community or city. This study is a subset of larger studies that aim to develop an urban food system framework, which utilizes modern approaches in framework development such as sustainability food indicators and a participatory approach. However, to achieve this, trends, gaps, and challenges of the current approach to food system studies need to be reviewed and discussed. A systematic analysis utilizing the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was conducted, and network analysis of publications was performed via VOS viewer.

The cases researched include examples of urban agriculture, food hubs, buyers' groups, and specialist retailers. The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation. The limitations to the expansion of alternative food networks are also discussed, including the restricted access to land for growing food, low public engagement, and the dependence on volunteer labor. The paper concludes by summarizing the contribution of alternative food networks to urban food systems and identifies issues for future research."", 'Due to the current challenges of climate change, population growth in urban settlements and resource depletion, agri-food researchers have put an increasing emphasis on the sustainability transitions of food systems. In this regard, there has been an increasing interest in the local food supply of cities and their surrounding regions, as local food is considered to be a contributing factor toward more sustainable, resilient and just urban food systems. Based on this background, a roadmapping process was conducted to assess the status quo and to identify measures to enhance the local food supply in the city-region of Graz in Austria. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 stakeholders, analysed textual materials and calculated food carrying capacities. The obtained data served as input for a series of three workshops, where measures were derived. Our results suggest that cooperation among agri-food stakeholders should be facilitated by local decision makers in order to promote food from regional sources within the target area. Furthermore, smart technologies can help to scale-up local food supply schemes, and to track down food stocks and flows more efficiently. Besides, food policy councils and open food labs can help to incubate food product innovations and to support partnerships among agri-food stakeholders, including local small-scale farmers. In the future, engagement and empowerment processes with local food stakeholders should be addressed to enable transformational processes.

A flood hazard map was generated using selected morphological and hydro-meteorological indicators. A flood vulnerability map was generated based on a literature review and a social survey weighed by experts' priorities using the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytic Network Process.

The index enables the development of an appropriate flood risk management strategy, tailored to those factors of vulnerability that have the greatest impact on the overall flood vulnerability of a given place. Currently, following a shift in the approach to flood protection, vulnerability has become a critical element of disaster mitigation. This index is an important contribution to the existing body of research as it can be applied to flood risk management strategies overcoming the ambiguity of definitions of vulnerability and the dynamic nature of temporal and spatial scales of analysis. The proposed flood vulnerability index is a multifaceted approach, encompassing physical, social, economic, environmental, and institutional attributes. In order to create the index, the literature on flood vulnerability was reviewed, including definitions, research methods, as well as the factors and constituents that are major components of vulnerability. The proposed indicator can be used by policy-makers responsible for flood risk management, especially in EU countries, in order to minimize the negative consequences of floods. Compared to other methods used (i.e., disaster loss estimation or modeling), the flood vulnerability index is easy to use when comparing different areas.', ""Several cities are exceptionally vulnerable to flood impacts due to increasing urbanization, population growth, and climate change. Quantifying flood vulnerability is useful for identifying the system's weakness, monitoring its evolution, and supporting targeted flood risk adaptation policies. One of the vital aims of assessing urban flood vulnerability is to create an understandable link between flood vulnerability conceptual theories and the daily decision-making process through an easily accessible tool. Although several studies have described the development of an integrated flood vulnerability index (FVI) combining physical, social, and economic dimensions in urban areas, this index has not been assessed in developing countries. Therefore, this study focuses on an integrated indicator-based approach to develop an urban FVI based on exposure, susceptibility, and resilience to urban flooding at the neighbourhood scale. To evaluate the flood vulnerability of the population, we used the Improvement of Vulnerability Assessment in Europe (MOVE) framework. Accordingly, the vulnerability indices cover exposure, susceptibility and resilience aspects. The index is applied to Alexandria, one of the most important coastal cities of Egypt, which is highly vulnerable due to its dense population, low adaptive capacity, flat topography, and exposure to various water-related disasters, such as cyclones, storm surges, bank erosion, sea-level rise, tidal floods, and frequent urban floods. In this study, we use inductive principal component analysis (PCA) to develop a composite indicator for the FVI and to evaluate the vulnerability of 101 census administrative units (sheyakhahs) in Alexandria. We apply the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to assess sample adequacy and perform data standardization for all indicators. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted for simplicity and comparison with the PCA results to assess their robustness. We clustered 58 and 13 flood vulnerability-related indicators into three major dimensions, i.e., physical, social, and economic, through PCA and the AHP, respectively. Official collected data are analysed using combined methods using advanced statistical analysis (SPSS) software and a geographic information system (GIS). The findings highlight the variability in flood vulnerability across highly urbanized and suburban areas. Based on the PCA, 38 indicators were defined as the most comprehensive flood vulnerability assessment (FVA) used in Egyptian cities. Additionally, due to reliability of the approach to indicator selection and the weighting process, the chosen 13 indicators for the AHP analysis yielded similar results. This research provides spatial planners and decision-makers with an integrated, comprehensive, and unified urban FVI to assess vulnerability and, thus, improve flood resilience in Egypt and countries in similar situations.""]",NA,Flooding,Equalities and justice

A key component of climate change adaptation and resilience is quantifying the likelihood that sub-hourly extreme precipitation will exceed historical levels in future climate scenarios. Despite this, current approaches to estimating future sub-hourly extreme precipitation return levels are deemed insufficient. The reason for this can be attributed to two factors: there is limited availability of data from convection-permitting climate models (capable of simulating sub-hourly precipitation adequately) and the statistical methods we use to extrapolate extreme precipitation return levels do not capture the physics governing global warming. We present a novel physical-based statistical method for estimating the extreme sub-hourly precipitation return levels. The proposed model, named TEmperature-dependent Non-Asymptotic statistical model for eXtreme return levels (TENAX), is based on a parsimonious non-stationary and non-asymptotic theoretical framework that incorporates temperature as a covariate in a physically consistent manner. We first explain the theory and present the TENAX model. Using data from several stations in Switzerland as a case study, we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce sub-hourly precipitation return levels and some observed properties of extreme precipitation. We then illustrate how the model can be utilized to project changes in extreme sub-hourly precipitation in a future warmer climate only based on climate model projections of temperatures during wet days and on foreseen changes in precipitation frequency. We conclude by discussing the uncertainties associated with the model, its limitations, and its advantages. With the TENAX model, one can project sub-hourly precipitation extremes at different return levels based on daily scale projections from climate models in any location globally where observations of sub-hourly precipitation data and near-surface air temperature are available."", ""The northeastern United States (NEUS) is a densely populated region with a number of major cities along the climatological storm track. Despite its economic and social importance, as well as the area's vulnerability to flooding, there is significant uncertainty around future trends in extreme precipitation over the region. Here, we undertake a regional study of the projected changes in extreme precipitation over the NEUS through the end of the twenty-first century using an ensemble of high-resolution, dynamically downscaled simulations from the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) project. We find that extreme precipitation increases throughout the region, with the largest changes in coastal regions and smaller changes inland. These increases are seen throughout the year, although the smallest changes in extreme precipitation are seen in the summer, in contrast to earlier studies. The frequency of heavy precipitation also increases such that there are relatively fewer days with moderate precipitation and relatively more days with either no or strong precipitation. Averaged over the region, extreme precipitation increases by +3%-5% degrees C-1 of local warming, with the largest fractional increases in southern and inland regions and occurring during the winter and spring seasons. This is lower than the +7% degrees C-1 rate expected from thermodynamic considerations alone and suggests that dynamical changes damp the increases in extreme precipitation. These changes are qualitatively robust across ensemble members, although there is notable intermodel spread associated with models' climate sensitivity and with changes in mean precipitation. Together, the NA-CORDEX simulations suggest that this densely populated region may require significant adaptation strategies to cope with the increase in extreme precipitation expected at the end of the next century. Significance StatementObservations show that the northeastern United States has already experienced increases in extreme precipitation, and prior modeling studies suggest that this trend is expected to continue through the end of the century. Using high-resolution climate model simulations, we find that coastal regions will experience large increases in extreme precipitation (+6.0-7.5 mm day(-1)), although there is significant intermodel spread in the trends' spatial distribution and in their seasonality. Regionally averaged, extreme precipitation will increase at a rate of similar to 2% decade(-1). Our results also suggest that the frequency of extreme precipitation will increase, with the strongest storms doubling in frequency per degree of warming. These results, taken with earlier studies, provide guidance to aid in resiliency preparation and planning by regional stakeholders."", 'The investigation of regional vulnerability to extreme hydroclimatic events (e.g., floods and hurricanes) is quite challenging due to its dependence on reliable precipitation estimates. Better understanding of past precipitation trends is crucial to examine changing precipitation extremes, optimize future water demands, stormwater infrastructure, extreme event measures, irrigation management, etc., especially if combined with future climate and population projections. The objective of the study is to investigate the spatial-temporal variability of average and extreme precipitation at a sub-regional scale, specifically in the Southern Mid-Atlantic United States, a region characterized by diverse topography and is among the fastest-growing areas in North America. Particularly, this work investigates past precipitation trends and patterns using the North American Land Data Assimilation System, Version 2 (NLDAS-2, 12 km/1 h resolution) reanalysis dataset during 1980-2018. Both parametric (linear regression) and non-parametric (e.g., Theil-Sen) robust statistical tools are employed in the study to analyze trend magnitudes, which are tested for statistical significance using the Mann-Kendall test. Standard precipitation indices from ETCCDI are also used to characterize trends in the relative contribution of extreme events to precipitation in the area. In the region an increasing trend (4.3 mm/year) is identified in annual average precipitation with similar to 34% of the domain showing a significant increase (at the 0.1 significance level) of +3 to +5 mm/year. Seasonal and sub-regional trends are also investigated, with the most pronounced increasing trends identified during summers along the Virginia and Maryland border. The study also finds a statistically significant positive trend (at a 0.05 significance level) in the annual maximum precipitation. Furthermore, the number of daily extremes (daily total precipitation higher than the 95th and 99th percentiles) also depicts statistically significant increases, indicating the increased frequency of extreme precipitation events. Investigations into the proportion of annual precipitation occurring on wet days and extremely wet days (95th and 99th percentile) also indicate a significant increase in their relative contribution. The findings of this study have the potential to improve local-scale decision-making in terms of river basin management, flood control, irrigation scheme scheduling, and stormwater infrastructure planning to address urban resilience to hydrometeorological hazards.']",NA,Flooding,Technological

Flood hazards disproportionately affect marginalized and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. This disproportionate flood exposure constitutes a form of environmental injustice. Few studies have undertaken a large-scale assessment of the long-term change of flood exposure. To fill this gap, this study utilized land use and flood zone data from 2001 to 2019 at a 5-year interval to analyze spatiotemporal changes in flood exposure in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Two indices, the Deviational Exposure Index and Socioeconomic Disparity Index, were introduced to measure flood exposure and the socioeconomic disparities associated with flood exposure. At the national level, the overall flood exposure in the CONUS decreased in the past two decades, indicating increasing awareness of flood risk in the country. But the local variations of flood exposure and its changing trends vary among communities. In general, coastal and riverine counties show a general avoidance of developing urban areas in flood zones, while inland counties show an opposite tendency of urban development in floodplains. The results of this study reveal socioeconomic and demographic disparities between communities in and out of flood zones and evaluate environmental injustice among disadvantaged populations.

Recent storm events, such as Hurricane Ida, brought flash floods to the city for the first time, with property damage and deaths. The identification of vulnerable populations and how to increase flood resilience to coastal and pluvial events are climate change adaptation goals for city officials, bureaucrats, scholars, and stakeholders. Methods: This analysis examines coastal and pluvial flood vulnerability by census tract in New York City. A variety of data sources are combined to create flood vulnerability maps using the exposure-sensitivityadaptive capacity framework. A principal components analysis (PCA) with orthogonal rotation of social variables identifies four distinct hazard-sensitive populations clustered in different parts of the city. Publicly provided adaptive capacity resource (transportation and evacuation, health, communications and information, and hazard mitigation) accessibility is defined by distance. Moderate and extreme flooding levels from coastal and pluvial storm events define exposure. Results: We identify specific areas in the city where flood exposure and hazard sensitivity are high and access to adaptive capacity resources is low. These locations are defined as high flood-vulnerable areas. Within the high flood-vulnerable areas, there are differences in the size of hazard-sensitive group populations (Hispanic poor, Asian immigrant, elderly living in high-rise buildings, and African American low-income). Conclusions: The spatial combination of these variables identifies locations where targeted policies can promote hazard resilience. Our results illustrate a potential model to address and enhance flood vulnerability policy in the city.', 'We evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of hurricane flood risk along the United States (US.) Atlantic and Gulf coasts under two different climate scenarios (current and future). The flood hazard is presented as the hurricane surge flood level with 1% annual exceedance probability (100-year flood) under the two scenarios, where the future scenario considers the effect of hurricane climatology change and sea level rise towards late-21st-century under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). This hazard information is combined with estimated vulnerability and disaster resilience of coastal communities to map the relative current and future risk employing different risk definitions. Several geographical techniques and spatial distributional models (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, spatial hotspot analysis, and spatial multivariate clustering analysis) are applied to systematically analyze the risk and identify statistically significant hotspots of the highest risk. Most of the high-risk hotspots are found in the Gulf coast region, particularly along the west coast of Florida. However, two out of three risk evaluation approaches also indicate New York City as a risk hotspot under the future climate-showing that the resultant risk is sensitive to the consideration of evaluation factors (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and resilience). Additionally, we apply a machine-learning algorithm-based spatial multivariate approach to map the spatially distinct groups based on the values of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and resilience. The results show that the counties in the highest risk group (value >3rd quartile, 15% of total counties, including New York City) in the future lack specifically in the community capital and the social components of community resilience. This assessment of coastal risk to hurricane flood has important policy-relevant implications to provide a focus-for-action for risk reduction and resilience enhancement for the US., where 6.5 million households live in the hurricane flood-prone areas.

This research defines a region-specific smart city model and revealing the role of this model in the resilience against disasters of the built environment. Design/methodology/approach The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was conducted in four steps. In Step 1, the authors suggested new smart environmental assessment criteria with climatic and geographical data within the scope of the collective mind of the region. In Step 2, they determined the expert group to evaluate within the scope of the AHP method and then compared the significance levels of the current and suggested smart environmental assessment criteria by the AHP method. Findings From the results, it turned out that smart urbanization processes, which are trying to relate to local characteristics, are of great importance in terms of ensuring urban resilience. The results also highlight that the existing smart environmental assessment criteria in the literature are insufficient to ensure the climatic resilience of the built environment in the face of natural disasters. Research limitations/implications The study is in an intermediary section, which has a gap in the literature due to its subject. Although it has focused on an acute problem and a current research problem, the lack of literature on the field has been a limitation. Determining the cities where the field studies would be conducted has been a major limitation. For an objective hypothesis test within the scope of the AHP method, the sample group should consist of experts working in smart city projects in cities that are in the top 3 in five different smart city rankings, where field studies are conducted. Within this limited cluster, creating a large sample group was an important limitation. Originality/value This research looks into the existing gaps of the relation between climate resilience of the built environment and the local smart city approach. This examination will foster a holistic approach in the practice of sustainable smart city in the built environment, thus reinforcing urban resilience and climate studies in the context of smart cities.', 'This article reports on the elements of adaptation to climate change in European Smart City initiatives in order to understand to what extent Smart Cities can be the answer in the fight against climate change.

As it is difficult to estimate the benefits of climate action in the short term due to often costly solutions, Smart City proposals could provide the economic incentive to create adaptive, energy-efficient, and sustainable societies. As the need for adaptive and resilient cities in the global context of climate change rises, the concept of Smart City might need to evolve into that of a Smart Sustainable City, positioning the environment at the core of its development. Results from this analysis suggest that the interaction between technology and nature can be enhanced when a Smart City approach promotes the integration of climate strategies and encourages the participation of citizens, something that is crucial since early adaptation efforts can safeguard smart infrastructure from climate impacts.', 'In recent years, smart technologies and networking solutions, such as Internet of things (IoT), have been adopted by most leading cities in China as ways to revitalize economic opportunities and strengthen their global resilience to climate change.

Chinese smart city policy and practices explore renewable energy and resources, increase public convenience, and make cities more comfortable and citizen friendly. Critical concerns are explored in such areas as integration (within the urban system, with other cities), governance, innovation, and finance. Finally, a policy vision is outlined to build up public-private collaborative networks, to encourage more innovations and investments in smart city initiatives, and to put more emphasis on smart services.']",NA,climate change,Technological

In the literature, there is relative consensus on how housing damage is shaped by pre-impact conditions at household and neighborhood levels. However, systematic longitudinal studies that compare the recovery trajectories of different types of housing are rare. Here, we examine long-term recovery trajectories after Hurricane Ike (2008) in Galveston, Texas using parcel level data for multifamily, single-family, and duplexes over an eightyear period. Overall, we found that recovery trajectories differed significantly across housing types. Multifamily housing and duplex homes recover more slowly compared to single-family houses after controlling for damage and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods. These findings substantiate conclusions of previous research and call for disaster recovery assistance programs targeting recovery disparities among residential types to better ensure broad-based housing recovery.', 'Deconstructing causal linkages between place attributes and disaster outcomes at coarse scales like zip codes and counties is difficult because heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics operating at finer scales are masked. However, capturing detailed disaster outcomes about individuals and households for large areas can be equally complicated. This dichotomy highlights the need for a more nuanced and empirically-driven approach to understanding financial disaster recovery support. This study assessed how social characteristics influenced federal disaster recovery support following the 2015 South Carolina floods. Ordinary linear and spatial regression models provided a mechanism for pinpointing statistically significant links between individual/compound vulnerabilities and resource distribution from four federal disaster response and recovery programmes. The study makes two unique contributions. First, exploration of how social characteristics influence recovery support is a critical, yet understudied path toward fair and equitable disaster recovery. Second, finer scale inquiry across a large impact area is rare in quantitative case studies of US disasters. While we found flood recovery assistance to be strongly associated with physical damage overall the relationship wase more tenuous in places with higher social vulnerability. Results indicate that future disaster recovery programs focusing on both physical damage and social vulnerable would lead to a more equitable disaster recoveries. Findings provide new understanding of equity at the intersection of social vulnerability, impacts, and disaster recovery and showcase both best-practices and areas for programme improvements for future disasters.', ""Problem, research strategy, and findings: Disaster impacts result from interactions between hazard exposure, physical vulnerability, and social vulnerability. We report empirical work from 1992 ' s Hurricane Andrew in Miami-Dade (FL) and 2008 ' s Hurricane Ike in Galveston (TX) to assess long-term trends in housing recovery. Longitudinal, parcel-level data on housing units along with neighborhood sociodemographic data permit analysis of the pace of recovery for different neighborhoods, populations, and housing types. Housing recovery is highly uneven for different population groups. Unsurprisingly, damage has major consequences; even after four years, the effects of damage are evident in the rebuilding process. Social vulnerability factors play differently in different settings. In Miami, income and race and ethnicity were critical determinants of higher losses and slower recovery rates, while in Galveston income was the more critical factor, with housing in lower-income areas suffering more damage and lagging significantly in the recovery process. Takeaway for practice: Effective land use policy and building codes can reduce physical vulnerability and ultimately damage, thus enhancing resilience for all. Differentials in impact and recovery trajectories suggest that assessment and the monitoring of recovery is critical to target resources to areas that are lagging. Perhaps most important is having an effective plan in place that addresses housing recovery issues to help reduce long-term consequences. Pre-event planning for housing and social change can help support community vision and overcome inequities.""]",NA,hurricane,Community

In the wake of recent flood disasters in the United States (US) and globally, more researchers are investigating social vulnerabilities as well as the role of cognition in explaining risk perceptions. This study analyzed how people in the US perceive the risk (i.e., likelihood and seriousness) of flooding via a layered analysis that considered several plausible and intertwined lines of inquiry from the risk perception literature. We surveyed 9250 individuals within nine major urban areas, including the largest city and one smaller city in each region. The National Flood Hazard Layer product provided data for deriving their potential exposure to flood hazards. The analyses tested and confirmed several hypotheses drawn from Social Vulnerability Theory and from Protective Motivation Theory: characteristics associated with social vulnerability (older, female, race/ethnic minorities, low income), previous experiences with and awareness of flood news, and potential exposure to flood hazard (local fraction of flood prone area) significantly increased risk perceptions of floods. Self-confidence in ability to cope with a future flood disaster lowered risk perceptions. This study is the first snapshot of flood risk perceptions nationwide in the US. It points to needs for more theoretically-driven research about flood risk perceptions and behaviors, flood risk communication within local communities, and more social and economic support for vulnerable populations.

Risk communication is an effective mechanism that affects risk perception and can significantly reduce flood risk. This study quantifies risk perception and communication in flood-prone rural areas of District Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan. The rural communities were divided into two zones based on the distance from rivers, i.e., Zone 1 (households within 0-3 km) and Zone 2 (households within 3-6 km). After a thorough literature review, indicators measured on the Likert scale were selected for risk perception and communication. Using Yamane's sampling, 420 samples were collected using a household survey. Chi-square and t-tests were used to identify differences between the two zones. Linear regression was performed to identify the socioeconomic determinants of risk communication and perception. Results showed that the people living away from the river had higher risk perception and received better risk communication than their peers. The main reason was attributed to their past flood experiences. The study also found a strong correlation between flood risk perception and risk communication. Hazard proximity was also found to affect risk perception and communication. People with higher risk perception are likely to seek risk communication information and engage in flood preparedness and mitigation measures. This study provides an insight into the need for risk communication for improving the effectiveness of flood risk reduction."", ""The widespread increase in flood hazards and the ensuing impacts have guided a change in approach to flood risk management especially in developed countries. This is based on the realisation that the integration of non-structural approaches to flood mitigation, for which the understanding of the social dimensions of flood risk is an important aspect, is needful. Flooding as a consequence of changing rainfall patterns and increased frequency of storm surges in the context of urban development has become a major risk in the coastal megacity of Lagos. The focus of flood management in the city has however largely been on structural measures with little attention directed to addressing the social processes which shape the vulnerability or resilience of flood-affected population. Risk perception is an aspect of the social construction of risk, the understanding of which is important in managing risks. The paper employs a combination of theoretical and non-theoretical methods including residents' self-perceived vulnerability and concerns about flood risk, and the psychometric paradigm approach to examine perception of flood risk by residents in flood-affected communities in the city. Data were collected through the administration of a purposely designed questionnaire to 1000 residents in flood-affected communities in the period following two major flood events in the city which occurred in 2011 and 2012.

A groundwater geochemistry study was conducted in Agra where 28 samples were collected from shallow aquifers in May 2016 from different sites. The aim of this research was to assess the quality of groundwater for drinking purposes in the study area. Arc-GIS has been used to prepare geographic information system-based spatial distribution maps of different major elements. The groundwater quality was analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters, major cations and anions and some trace metals. The observed values were compared with BIS and WHO standards. Statistical parameters such as the mean, median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis were used to analyze the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater. Correlation coefficient analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to identify the sources of the water constituents. Our results showed that most of the samples exceeded the acceptable limit for drinking water standards. The sequence of abundance of the main cations was generally Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, while the anions in order of abundance were HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- and NO3- > F-. All of the trace metals were within the permissible limit except for iron and manganese. The hazard index value of 5.7 x 10(-2) indicated that there was no potential health risk in the study area. Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42- were the dominant hydrogeochemical facies in the majority of the groundwater samples. Most of the parameters such as TDS, Cl, HCO3, SO42-, NO3, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ and TH showed strong correlations with each other, which were due to natural processes such as weathering, exchangeable ions and reduction/oxidation, as well as anthropogenic activity around the study area. The water quality index indicated that the water quality was poor at 46.43% of the sampling sites, very poor at 28.57% of the sites and unsuitable for drinking purposes at 25% of the sampling sites.

This vital resource is deteriorating due to rapidly growing urbanization, pollution, overexploitation, and climate change. However, it is unclear how much this specific resource deteriorates over time. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate groundwater resources qualitatively and quantitatively in the peri-urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study used the modified Mann-Kendall trend test, hotspot analysis, groundwater recharge estimation, multivariate statistical analysis, and the water quality index (WQI) mapping. The trend analysis of groundwater levels indicates that in the most recent year, groundwater levels close to industrial areas have declined at a maximum rate of 1.18 m/year. The estimated groundwater recharge reveals that it is highest (480 mm/year) on rural agricultural land and lowest (220 mm/year) in urban areas. With a 99% confidence level, the groundwater water trend cluster analysis indicates the hotspots of groundwater level depletion near the industrial area. The results showed that Mn, Fe, and As exceeded the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended limit for drinking water by 76.92%, 61.53%, and 23.07%, respectively. The principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering results indicate that groundwater quality is influenced by rock-water interaction and human interventions. The WQI results suggest that 47.05% of the samples were excellent, 7.69% were good, 9.96% were poor, 17.65% were very poor, and the remaining 17.65% were unfit for drinking purposes.

This study investigates the determination of the contributions of these factors to the groundwater level changes with the HydroSight model. The unconfined superficial aquifer in the Gnangara region in Western Australia was used as a case study. It was found that rainfall dominates long-term (1992-2014) groundwater level changes and the contribution rate of rainfall reduced because the rainfall decreased over time. The mean rainfall contribution rate is 77% for climate and land cover analysis and 90% for climate and pumping analysis. Secondly, the increasing groundwater pumping activities had a significant influence on groundwater level and its mean contribution rate on groundwater level decline is -23%. The land cover changes had limited influence on long-term groundwater level changes and the contribution rate is stable over time with a mean of 2%. Results also showed spatial heterogeneity: the groundwater level changes were mainly influenced by rainfall and groundwater pumping in the southern study region, and the groundwater level changes were influenced by the combination of rainfall, land cover and groundwater pumping in the northern study region. This research will assist in developing a quantitative understanding of the influences of different factors on groundwater level changes in any aquifer in the world.']",NA,climate change,Water and sanitation

To establish a practical method for evaluating tsunami-related fire predictions, we previously developed a method for evaluating the tsunami debris thickness distribution that uses tsunami computation results and static parameters for tsunami numerical analysis. We then used this evaluation method to successfully reproduce the tsunami debris accumulation trend. We then developed an empirical building fragility function that relates the production of debris not only to inundation depth but also to the topographic gradient and the proportion of robust buildings. Using these empirical evaluation models, along with conventional tsunami numerical analysis data, we carried out a practical tsunami debris prediction for Owase City, Mie Prefecture, a potential disaster area for a Nankai Trough mega-earthquake. This prediction analysis method can reveal hazards which go undetected by a conventional tsunami inundation analysis. These results indicate that it is insufficient to characterize the tsunami hazard by inundation area and inundation depth alone when predicting the hazard of a huge tsunami; moreover, more practically, it is necessary to predict the hazard based on the effect of tsunami debris.', ""We revisited the lessons of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake Tsunami disaster specifically on the response and impact, and discussed the paradigm shift of Japan's tsunami disaster management policies and the perspectives for reconstruction. Revisiting the modern histories of Tohoku tsunami disasters and pre-2011 tsunami countermeasures, we clarified how Japan's coastal communities have prepared for tsunamis. The discussion mainly focuses on structural measures such as seawalls and breakwaters and non-structural measures of hazard map and evacuation. The responses to the 2011 event are discussed specifically on the tsunami warning system and efforts to identify the tsunami impacts. The nation-wide post-tsunami survey results shed light on the mechanisms of structural destruction, tsunami loads and structural vulnerability to inform structural rehabilitation measures and land-use planning. Remarkable paradigm shifts in designing coastal protection and disaster mitigation measures were introduced, leading with a new concept of potential tsunami levels: Prevention (Level 1) and Mitigation (Level 2) levels according to the level of 'protection'. The seawall is designed with reference to Level 1 tsunami scenario, while comprehensive disaster management measures should refer to Level 2 tsunami for protection of human lives and reducing potential losses and damage. Throughout the case study in Sendai city, the proposed reconstruction plan was evaluated from the tsunami engineering point of view to discuss how the post 2011 paradigm was implemented in coastal communities for future disaster mitigation.

In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines tsunami flood and evacuation modelling with statistical analysis, to examine the pedestrian evacuation potential of 67 urban samples extracted from 12 case studies in Chile. Our findings show that urban form parameters like the number of exit points out of an endangered area, the mean distance from the street network to these points, and the population density, can have a noticeable impact on tsunami evacuation times, which nonetheless is significantly dependent on the evacuees' departure time. Moreover, we demonstrate that Chilean urban coastal development has been noticeably carried out through grid-like form patterns that might contribute to hinder evacuation in case of a tsunami emergency.""]",NA,tsunami,building

The results of our research identify varied perceptions about flood vulnerability and resilience by the community. Overall, our respondents regarded flood incidents as a high-risk disaster to their livelihoods, but some communities appeared to have higher coping strategies than others within the same administrative division. The respondents generally perceived that proximity to flood sources would increase flood vulnerability and frequency. Compared to other communities, Sedawatta community experienced most frequent floods, and 93% lived within 100 m from the river. The respondents had taken measures to mitigate floods mostly by elevating houses.

According to the Arup and Rockefeller Foundation's City Resilience indicators, the key elements for building resilience in PNSAP include effective emergency response services, comprehensive hazard monitoring and risk assessment, and emergency medical care. In addition, the focus group discussions and keyword analysis identified the following critical components for strengthening flood resilience: financial aspects, community awareness and preparedness, multi-stakeholder collaboration, citizen engagement, and urban flood monitoring and data management. Moreover, to gain insight into the perceptions of people in local communities, the results of a household survey (n = 552) indicated that approximately one-third of the respondents had never engaged in flood preparedness activities. Neither the gender nor the education level of the respondents significantly influenced their engagement in flood preparedness. The respondents also perceived that infrastructure flexibility, affordable transport networks, flood monitoring and data management, the adequate provision of critical services, and reliable communication systems in building resilience were important during a flood disaster. These results provide valuable insight into the community's perception of the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction mechanisms for building flood resilience in PNSAP and can serve as a useful guide for future resilience-building initiatives. By addressing these factors, PNSAP could enhance its resilience to the impacts of flooding and contribute to the global field of flood management and resilience building."", ""This research aims to investigate the effect of climatic and hydrological factors on flood hazards and assess flood resilience in Ayutthaya, Thailand, using the 10 essentials for making cities resilient modified by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).

The results indicate that runoff is considered the most influential factor in flood hazards, followed by land use, rainfall, and historical flood events, sequentially. Regarding the flood incident management concept, a questionnaire survey (n = 552) was conducted to understand the impacts of flood on local communities. The findings reveal that 50% of respondents had never received any flood information or participated in training sessions on flood preparedness. Most reported their concerns about the inadequate supply of drinking water during a flood. Spearman's correlation coefficient shows positive correlations between flood disaster relief payments, preparedness training, access to flood hazard mapping, emergency health services, and their flood preparation actions. According to the modified UNDRR indicators, the top three highest AHP values in building community resilience to flood hazards in Ayutthaya are flood risk scenario identification, the effectiveness of emergency flood disaster response, integrated urban planning, and disaster risk reduction.

Closed forests near the open forest/tundra boundary generally correspond to residual patches of a once larger forest community. Whether these forest patches have survived as untouched, firefree communities or as resilient communities during the Holocene remains unknown. To answer to this question, we reconstructed the successional history of two black spruce closed-crown forests and one jack pine forest near the northern limit of closed forest ecosystems. Stand-scale postfire succession was analysed based on charcoal macrofossils. Extensive C-14 dating and botanical identification of charcoal fragments located at the organic soil surface and buried in the mineral podzolic solum were used to reconstruct the successional pathways of the sites. The forest sites developed in a context of continuous fire disturbance, except for a short interval of several centuries. The fire history of the three sites is similar with a fire frequency of 34-37 fires over the last 5000-5800 years, which corresponds to a mean fire interval of 150-180 years. Based on parametric and nonparametric estimators, the regional fire regime of the Laforge area (combined fire data of two sites located about 7 km from each other) was most likely characterized by 38 fires over the last 5000-5800 years, i.e., at an interval of about 150-160 years. Birch (Betula papyrifera) was present in the spruce sites between 5800 and 3000 cal. years BP. Jack pine arrived at the pine site about 3000 cal. years BP, at the time when birch was extirpated from the spruce forests. The closed-crown forests near the open forest/tundra boundary are resilient postfire ecosystems which regenerated successfully since mid-Holocene. Compositional change of these forests, which led to the decline of birch but maintained the dominance of conifers, appears related to cooler and wetter conditions of late Holocene. Climatic conditions also slowed the eastward migration of jack pine, which explains the late arrival of this species at its northeastern range. Our data suggest that fire disturbance in these sites of the boreal biome has been a continuous and positive regenerative process since mid-Holocene despite the influence of climatic change on the tree flora.', ""Mountain forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and protection from natural hazards. Forest cover in the European Alps has increased over the last century, but in recent years, these forests have experienced an increasing rate of natural disturbances by agents such as windthrow, bark beetle outbreaks, and forest fires. These disturbances pose a challenge for forest management, making it important to understand how site and stand characteristics, land use legacies and recent management influence disturbance probability. We combined a dataset of forest disturbances detected from space with in-situ forest management records, allowing us to differentiate between different types of disturbances for the Canton of Graubunden, Switzerland, in the years 2005-2018. The resulting dataset of over 28'000 attributed disturbance patches (corresponding to a disturbed forest area of ca. 23'600 ha) was combined with information on topography, forest structure, and historical forest cover. A machine-learning approach was used to investigate the non-linear and interacting relationships between potential drivers and disturbance occurrence. Natural disturbances (especially windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks) were most common at lower elevations, on shallow and south-facing slopes, and in even-aged, spruce-dominated stands with a closed canopy. Forests established in the 20th century were significantly more susceptible to natural disturbances than forests that were already present before 1880, which may be due to the uniform age and vertical structure of secondary forests, as well as legacy effects of former agricultural use. On the other hand, forest management more often took place in forests present before 1880. Management interventions (such as thinning) in turn increased the susceptibility to natural disturbances in the short term. This finding emphasizes the need to balance short-term increases in disturbance susceptibility with long-term benefits in forest resilience when planning management interventions in mountain forests. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple interactive drivers, including management and land-use history, for understanding forest disturbance regimes."", 'The dynamics of the boreal forest has followed several successional trajectories during the Holocene caused by recurrent stand-scale, abiotic and biotic disturbances. Under stable environmental conditions, site disturbances should favor the regeneration of forest communities enabling the recovery process to produce forests similar to the pre-disturbance states. However, a failure in the post-disturbance recovery process can also occur to shift the forest communities to alternative states. Although fire is the main disturbance factor affecting the dynamics of the boreal forest, long-term resilience of most forest ecosystems remains poorly known because of lack of stand-scale paleoecological evidence. To evaluate the resilience ability of boreal forest ecosystems, we reconstructed their Holocene fire history and documented their successional pathways at the stand scale in two climatically-contrasted regions (western continental versus eastern humid climates of boreal Quebec, Canada) based on botanically-identified and C-14-dated soil charcoal remains. Since mid-Holocene, western closed-crown conifer forests were resilient to fire disturbance, but hardwood trees declined significantly. Yet in the eastern region, closed-crown conifer forests similar to that observed today seems to have remained in place since its origin. In both regions, moderate fire frequency leads to a recurrence dynamics that favors renewal of forests stands with the same composition. However, balsam fir - paper birch stands follow a successional pattern characterized by the establishment of paper birch, with subsequent increasing abundance of balsam fir. This allows the maintenance of forests composed of these species, whose dominance fluctuates according to the time elapsed since the last fire. The succession from black spruce to balsam fir stands seems to be an uncommon process that requires a prolonged fire-free period. Although most closed-crown forests are resilient postfire ecosystems which have persisted over several millennia, their resilience is precarious as evidenced by the transformation of some forests into lichen woodlands after fire.']",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

In this study, we answer these research questions by proposing a data-driven framework that can predict post-disaster mobility decisions and simultaneously unravel the influence of various information on online social media.

We tested our approach using real world data collected from more than 13 million unique Twitter users during Hurricane Sandy. Experiments verified that we can improve the predictive accuracy of return and displacement behavior, and also quantify the influence of online information. In contrast to popular beliefs, it was found that information posted by the crowd influenced the decisions more than information disseminated by official accounts.

Consequently, the reliability of their decision making ability remains questionable. This paper presents an exploratory analysis of empirical household survey data on the information seeking, sharing activity, and perceptions of information reliability on social media platforms across different population groups during three major hurricane storm events in the United States between 2017 and 2018. The results of this analysis suggest significant associations between social media use and socioeconomic factors: (1) Socioeconomic factors along with geographic effects play a role in determining not only platform uptake but both motivations for information seeking and the action of information sharing on social media, (2) The type of social media platform influences the type of information people seek, (3) Households from lower socioeconomic and minority backgrounds were more likely to use social media platforms to sought out different information on social media than their peer, (4) perceptions of information reliability are also influenced by social divides, where households in rural areas, lower income groups, and racial minorities were more likely to report greater unreliability in social media information.

In-depth research on the relationship between landscape changes and runoff is a precondition of urban watershed restoration and stormwater management. Taking the Yangmei River Basin as the study area, the storm water management model (SWMM), landscape index, correlation analysis, and the random forest importance measure were integrated to simulate the runoff process under urban development and climate change scenarios and analyze the direction and contribution of landscape composition and configuration to runoff changes. Results indicated that the runoff change rate relative to the reference period under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios gradually decreased as the return period increased. Landscape composition and configuration were significantly correlated with runoff change. Specifically, woodland could reduce runoff, while farmland and water bodies positively impacted runoff changes. The higher fragmented landscape pattern was likely to have altered the runoff, while landscape patterns of a larger size, higher concentrations, and a declining richness typically reduced runoff. The random forest importance evaluation demonstrated the significant contributions of Patch Density, Shannon's Diversity Index, and Large Path Index to runoff. By exploring the potential relationship between landscape changes and runoff, urban planners can better understand the runoff process and find feasible ecological landscape optimization schemes, thus strengthening the sustainable management of water resources and enhancing the resilience of cities to climate change."", 'We simulated watershed hydrologic response to land use scenarios representing different sets of policies for suburban development and watershed management in an urbanizing watershed near Portland, Oregon. We asked (1) Can watershed-scale planning and development policies reduce the hydrologic impacts of urbanization? (2) How effective are different policies (including green neighborhood design, riparian protection, and representative Low Impact Development (LID) stormwater controls) in maintaining the pre-development hydrologic regime? and (3) Does climate change influence these results? We co-developed 50-year land and water management scenarios with a stakeholder advisory committee and used a spatially-explicit natural and human systems model to evaluate changes in water balance and streamflow characteristics under each scenario. We also used a factorial analysis to explore the influence of individual scenario elements on watershed hydrology. Results indicate that the biggest driver of change for this watershed was the spatial extent of development, followed by the nature of the development pattern, climate, forest harvest, and use of LID controls. Stormwater runoff increased as developed area increased, as did stream discharge for both periods of high and low flow. Increases in evapotranspiration (ET) with climate warming were offset by reductions in ET with development. Designs that condensed development and preserved upland and riparian forest showed the greatest potential for maintaining pre-development water balance and streamflow regimes, thereby reducing impacts of urbanization. These results bridge spatial and temporal scales important to decision-makers, highlighting the importance of considering impacts over time of neighborhood-scale development decisions on watershed-scale hydrology.', 'Communities are coping with changes in runoff quantity and quality, stemming mainly from changes in climate and land use/land cover (LULC); there is a need to identify the most adaptable strategies that improve community resilience. However, the joint impacts of climate and LULC change have rarely been assessed at local scales. To address these needs, we assessed the response of runoff and pollutant loads from Broad Run, a rapidly developing watershed in northern Virginia, to projected climate and LULC change. Climate data from two downscaled Global Climate Models (GCMs) were used to force an urban watershed model, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), while forecasts of LULC change were derived from the Chesapeake Bay Land Change Model (CBLCM). Two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), 4.5 and 8.5, a historic baseline (1995-2020), and projected periods (2040-2065); and four LULC change scenarios designated agricultural conservation (AC), forest conservation (FC), growth management (GM), and historical trend (HT) were used to create a series of ensemble simulations of coupled LULC and climate change. Results indicated that, under RCP 8.5, annual precipitation is projected to increase substantially more than RCP 4.5. Projected LULC change resulted in a projected increase in imperviousness from 6.3% to 13.1%. Results indicated that climate change will likely increase the seasonal variability of runoff, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP) for both RCPs. The largest increase for a single LULC change (without climate change) scenario for runoff, TSS, TN, and TP was 32.6%, 33.4%, 31.6%, and 35.8%, respectively. which occurred with the HT scenario. Results of LULC change also indicated that more pollutant loads were associated with increased imperviousness from increased urban development and loss of deciduous forests and grasslands. The largest increase for climate and LULC change scenarios in runoff, TSS, TN, and TP was 67.6%, 66.7%, 63.4%, and 69.4%, respectively, which occurred with the RCP 8.5 and HT scenarios. Similar, but smaller increases were obtained for other scenarios, suggesting that climate and LULC change may be synergistic, likely undermining watershed restoration efforts. The results of our study also indicate that runoff, TSS, TN, and TP are expected to be more affected by changes in future LULC than by projected changes in climate. Our study can be used to inform watershed restoration efforts, urban planning, and environmental policy. The combined impact of climate and LULC change will likely generate increased runoff, and nutrients and sediment loading, indicating that robust mitigation strategies are needed for watershed restoration to succeed.']",NA,climate change,Urban design and planning

Most research on soil health has focused on agricultural lands used for food production, but creating more climate resilient cities will rely on improving our understanding of soil health in urban landscapes such as turfgrass. This study assessed the soil microbial diversity and major soil health parameters of three turfgrass landscapes with varying degrees of management intensity, an unmanaged prairie, and an agricultural site from three metropolitan areas in the Midwestern United States. Bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were significantly affected by location, land use, and management age with the interaction between land use and location explaining the most variance (25 % for bacteria and 14 % for fungi). Deviations in fungal alpha-diversity reflected the difference in management, with unmanaged prairie locations having consistently greater fungal alpha-diversity than that of managed turfgrasses and agricultural sites. The relative abundance of the beneficial fungi Glomeromycetes was significantly greater in the lawn turfgrass than any other land uses; however, this was biased by a high relative abundance from a single lawn site with relatively low soil phosphorus content (2.8 mg/kg). Bacterial and fungal community composition significantly correlated with soil P, Fe, and C content, pH, organic matter, sand and clay content, and the overall soil health rating. The majority of these soil parameters significantly and positively correlated with each other along with microbial process indicators including respiration rate, active carbon, and protein content. These soil health parameters and the microbiome assembly constitute the potential driving factors for many crucial microbial processes that drive ecosystem services and can be used to create more sustainable urban landscapes.', 'Biodiversity is known to affect ecosystem resistance and have implications for the maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under climate change. Compared to numbers of studies focusing on above-ground vegetation, the response of below-ground communities to abiotic stresses along plant diversity gradients is often ignored and is considered an important knowledge gap in ecosystem ecology. Here we conducted an integrative research to evaluate the resistance of plant biomass, and soil microbial communities and associated functional profiles to drought under varying plant diversity. We carried out a 3-year manipulation experiment by factorially controlling plant diversity gradient (1, 2, 4 and 8 species richness) and soil moisture treatment (drought and non-drought), and investigated the responses of plant biomass, soil bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition, soil glomalin, and five key soil enzymes. We found that plant diversity significantly improved the resistance of soil fungal communities and microbial functional profiles characterized by soil glomalin and five key enzymes, which was partly driven by the availability and accessibility of soil resources (e.g. soil moisture and organic matter) mediated by plant diversity. Furthermore, our results indicated that the enhanced resistance of fungal communities was consistent with ecological insurance theory that diverse fungal communities at high plant diversity had a higher probability of containing taxa that adapt to drought. Synthesis. Our study provides novel empirical insights into the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of plant diversity on resistance of above-ground vegetation and below-ground biota to drought, with implications for understanding ecosystem response to climate change and improving biodiversity conservation practices.', 'Climate change can influence soil microorganisms directly by altering their growth and activity but also indirectly via effects on the vegetation, which modifies the availability of resources. Direct impacts of climate change on soil microorganisms can occur rapidly, whereas indirect effects mediated by shifts in plant community composition are not immediately apparent and likely to increase over time. We used molecular fingerprinting of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil to investigate the effects of 17 years of temperature and rainfall manipulations in a species-rich grassland near Buxton, UK. We compared shifts in microbial community structure to changes in plant species composition and key plant traits across 78 microsites within plots subjected to winter heating, rainfall supplementation, or summer drought. We observed marked shifts in soil fungal and bacterial community structure in response to chronic summer drought. Importantly, although dominant microbial taxa were largely unaffected by drought, there were substantial changes in the abundances of subordinate fungal and bacterial taxa. In contrast to short-term studies that report high resistance of soil fungi to drought, we observed substantial losses of fungal taxa in the summer drought treatments. There was moderate concordance between soil microbial communities and plant species composition within microsites. Vector fitting of community-weighted mean plant traits to ordinations of soil bacterial and fungal communities showed that shifts in soil microbial community structure were related to plant traits representing the quality of resources available to soil microorganisms: the construction cost of leaf material, foliar carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and leaf dry matter content. Thus, our study provides evidence that climate change could affect soil microbial communities indirectly via changes in plant inputs and highlights the importance of considering long-term climate change effects, especially in nutrient-poor systems with slow-growing vegetation.']",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

Based on the data from the first national comprehensive risk survey of natural disasters, a refined classification study of urban building groups was carried out. Based on the existing evaluation methods of seismic resilience of individual buildings, the recovery time was selected as the resilience evaluation index to calculate the effect of internal factors on the seismic resilience of urban building groups. Then, we studied the quantitative relationship between external factors (i.e., disaster relief capacity, population density, and economic level) and the evaluation indicators of seismic resilience of urban building groups, and we proposed the kilometer grid coefficient. Based on that, we proposed a calculation method of the effect of external factors on the seismic resilience of urban building groups. Considering the influence of internal and external factors, the evaluation model for the seismic resilience of urban building groups was established. And the model was applied in a typical city. This paper proposes a method to evaluate the seismic resilience of urban building groups, which can master the functional recovery time of urban building groups after an earthquake. Based on the proposed model, we can optimize the functional recovery path and emergency rescue path of the disaster area, as well as improve the resilience of urban building systems and the construction of resilient cities.', ""Several studies have been carried out to assess the building's seismic vulnerability, to mitigate the seismic risk in urban areas, which is one of the most devastating natural hazards causing considerable economic and human losses. These studies must be incorporated to improve the planning of urban areas to have resistant and resilient cities in case of disasters. The seismic feedback has shown that the build-back-better concept has a direct impact on the city's economic growth. In this paper, the existing buildings' resilience is assessed, in order to highlight the capacity of these last to keep the functionality when an earthquake occurs. This building's resilience has been determined for three types of structures: masonry, reinforced concrete and steel, according to the reconstruction time, the reconstruction cost and the damage state. This last has been assessed from empirical fragility curves developed using the log normal distribution for five structures typologies (Unreinforced masonry; reinforced masonry; RC frame; RC shear walls/Mixed RC frame-RC shear walls and steel structures). A seismic resilience scenario was performed using a geographic information system (GIS) and applied for the Blida city (Algeria) classified as a high seismic zone according to Algerian seismic regulations. According to the results found, the old districts of the Blida city, built mainly during the so-called pre-code period, will not be resilient in case of disaster.

Special attention is given to evaluating the magnitude of economic losses caused by earthquakes, particularly the assessment of different levels of seismic risk, in order to protect the population and territories located in seismically active areas. To ensure sustainable development of countries, it is essential to estimate the economic losses that will occur in regions due to strong earthquakes and forecast them within the specified return periods at given probabilities. Measures can then be implemented to mitigate the consequences of earthquakes.For the basis of seismic risk assessment, maps of seismic intensity increment and an improved map of seismic hazard have been developed, taking into account the engineering-geological conditions of the territory of Uzbekistan and the seismic characteristics of soils.For seismic risk map development, databases were created based on GIS platforms, allowing us to systematize and evaluate the regional distribution of information on seismic hazards, the number of buildings and construction types, the coefficient of the seismic vulnerability of buildings, the cadastral value of buildings, etc.']",NA,earthquake,building

In particular, urban flooding continues to be a concern for both developed and developing countries. Increasing physical risk associated with environmental changes combined with rapid land use change and development make many urban areas more vulnerable to floods. Floods are not solely based on hydro-meteorological conditions, but also result from human activities such as unplanned land use or haphazard development. While there is a growing body of research focused on understanding the impacts of land use on flood impacts in the United States, little empirical research has been conducted outside of the country although many other nations experience flooding. In particular, many countries in south and east Asia have undergone rapid urbanization concurrent with industrialization and population growth, resulting in worsening flood problems over time. To address this knowledge gap, this study examines the factors contributing to flood loss in Seoul, Korea, with a particular focus on land use status and change. Panel regression models are analyzed using actual flood loss data for Seoul from 2003 to 2012. Results indicate that urban built-up land with higher impervious surfaces and agricultural land may cause more flood damage than other land uses analyzed in the study. However, a high density development of compact design can decrease flood loss. These results indicate the importance of resilient land use planning in urban areas. Overall, this study provides insights to planners and decision makers about how they can effectively reduce flood risk and associated adverse impacts.', 'Flood risk is increasing in urban communities due to climate change and socioeconomic development. Socioeconomic development is a major cause of urban expansion in flood-prone regions, as it places more physical, economic, and social infrastructure at risk. Moreover, in light of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations, it has become an international imperative to move toward sustainable cities. Current approaches to quantify this risk use scenario-based methods involving arbitrary projections of city growth. These methods seldom incorporate geographical, social, and economic factors associated with urbanization and cannot mimic city growth under various urban development plans. In this paper, we introduce a framework for understanding the interactions between urbanization and flood risk as an essential ingredient for flood risk management. This framework integrates an urban growth model with a hazard model to explore flood risk under various urban development scenarios. We then investigate the effectiveness of coupling nonstructural flood mitigation measures-in terms of urban planning policies and socioeconomic incentives-with urban growth processes to achieve sustainable and resilient communities. Using this framework, we can not only simulate urban expansion dynamics through time and its effect on flood risk but also model the growth of a region under various urban planning policies and assess the effectiveness of these measures in reducing flood risk. Our analysis reveals that while current urban development plans may put more people and assets at flood risk, the nonstructural strategies considered in this study mitigated the consequences of floods. Such a framework could be used to assist city planners and stakeholders in examining tradeoffs between costs and benefits of future land development in achieving sustainable and resilient cities.', 'Coastal flood risk facing urban communities is increasing due to the compound impacts of sea level rise (SLR) and urban growth. Accurate information on future dynamic risk of coastal flooding and its physical and socioeconomic drivers is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation. However, the current scenarios regarding urban development are insufficient to predict the future dynamic spatial distribution of urban socioeconomic and physical growth, hindering the exact and dynamic assessment of future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban development to the future dynamics of city-level coastal flood risk have not been examined. Therefore, here we developed a land use-based urban growth scenario for the temporally and spatially explicit simulation of future urban growth in terms of buildings, roads and electrical facilities, and combined it with a local temporally explicit SLR scenario, into a hazard-exposure-vulnerability model, for the purpose of dynamic risk assessment of coastal flooding on the urban built environment in Xiamen, China by 2050, and accordingly examined the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth. Our results demonstrated a good performance of the land use-based urban growth model. SLR and urban growth will increase future coastal flood risk (represented by the expected annual damage, EAD) in varying degrees, but their combination is projected to exacerbate future flood damages significantly, indicating that considering either SLR or urban growth in isolation will underestimate future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth are dynamic over time, depending on the rate of SLR and the stage of urbanization: for example, the change in coastal flood risk is mainly attributable to urban growth in the phase of rapid urbanization before 2033 in Xiamen, yet the contribution of urban growth then becomes less important compared to SLR, when urbanization slows down, while SLR reaches a threshold after accelerating growth. The approach and results of our study can be considered a decision support tool, to help decision makers assess future coastal flood risk and detect the relative importance of each driving force, in order to employ land use planning, nature-based solutions and engineering protection, to achieve sustainable and resilient coastal cities.']",NA,Flooding,Urban design and planning

These include the transition from the Preclassic to the Classic, and from Classic to the Postclassic. Previous research emphasized a causal relationship between drought and cultural change, or so-called collapse in the Maya region. Recent advances in the range and precision of climate-sensitive proxies and the development of new archives have enabled quantitative reconstructions of past hydroclimate, as well as providing evidence of high impact, short-duration events, such as tropical cyclones. Simultaneously, archaeological research has unearthed widespread evidence of technologies used by the Maya to exert control over water resources in urban, rural, and agricultural settings. Evidence suggests that many of these water features were in use for multiple generations, possibly centuries, and many were constructed during the Terminal Preclassic and Terminal Classic periods. We suggest that, given the availability of new archaeological and paleoclimate records, these data can be combined to identify the full complexity of Maya adaptation to hydroclimate variability to emphasize adaptation and resilience to both water scarcity and over-abundance (e.g., flooding). Such syntheses, which can offer lessons for present-day efforts to grapple with regional climate change, will benefit from additional studies in data-poor zones of the Maya region, as well as public archiving of paleoclimate and archaeological data.', ""This paper explores the possible links between rapid climate change (RCC) and social change in the Near East and surrounding regions (Anatolia, central Syria, southern Israel, Mesopotamia, Cyprus and eastern and central Sahara) during the 'long' 4th millennium (similar to 4500-3000) BC. Twenty terrestrial and 20 marine climate proxies are used to identify long-term trends in humidity involving transitions from humid to arid conditions and vice versa. The frequency distribution of episodes of relative aridity across these records is calculated for the period 6300-2000 BC, so that the results may be interpreted in the context of the established arid episodes associated with RCC around 6200 and 2200 BC (the 8.2 and 4.2 kyr events). We identify two distinct episodes of heightened aridity in the early-mid 4th, and late 4th millennium BC. These episodes cluster strongly at 3600-3700 and 3100-3300 BC. There is also evidence of localised aridity spikes in the 5th and 6th millennia BC. These results are used as context for the interpretation of regional and local archaeological records with a particular focus on case studies from western Syria, the middle Euphrates, southern Israel and Cyprus. Interpretation of the records involves the construction of plausible narratives of human-climate interaction informed by concepts of adaptation and resilience from the literature on contemporary (i.e. 21st century) climate change and adaptation. The results are presented alongside well-documented examples of climatically-influenced societal change in the central and eastern Sahara, where detailed geomorphological studies of ancient environments have been undertaken in tandem with archaeological research. While the narratives for the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean remain somewhat speculative, the use of resilience and adaptation frameworks allows for a more nuanced treatment of human climate interactions and recognises the diversity and context-specificity of human responses to climatic and environmental change.

Most early complex societies developed in regions where the climatic parameters faced by ancient subsistence farmers were varied but rain falls primarily in one season. In contrast, the Indus Civilization developed in a specific environmental context that spanned a very distinct environmental threshold, where winter and summer rainfall systems overlap. There is now evidence to show that this region was directly subject to climate change during the period when the Indus Civilization was at its height (ca. 2500-1900 BC). The Indus Civilization, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to understand how an ancient society coped with diverse and varied ecologies and change in the fundamental environmental parameters. This paper integrates research carried out as part of the Land, Water and Settlement project in northwest India between 2007 and 2014. Although coming from only one of the regions occupied by Indus populations, these data necessitate the reconsideration of several prevailing views about the Indus Civilization as a whole and invigorate discussion about human-environment interactions and their relationship to processes of cultural transformation.""]",NA,other,

This can be challenging for lake restoration, given the relative strengths, magnitudes and speed of the exploitation. In this paper, we reconstructed the ecological changes over the past century and identified the regime shifts based on subfossil aquatic biota (chironomid records) in three shallow lakes (Shahu, Yanxi and Futou Lake) along an urban-rural gradient in the Yangtze floodplain, China. Our results illustrated the differences among lakes in trajectories, timing of critical transition and current ecological status. Eutrophic chironomid taxa increased markedly and replaced macrophyte-related taxa in urban Shahu Lake and suburban Yanxi Lake, indicated by the shift from a stable, vegetation-dominated state to an alternative, algal-dominated state in 1963 CE and 1975 CE respectively. The ecological regime in rural Futou Lake transited around 1980 CE but it is still in a relatively clear water state with abundant macrophytes due to anthropogenic hydrological controls. The greatest variance of chironomid compositional changes in both Shahu and Yanxi Lake was captured by anthropogenic pollutants, and analyses show that when these pressures are high they may be further amplified by climate warming. Responses along the urban-rural gradient are exemplified by urban Shahu Lake having shifted to a fragile regime with weak resistance and resilience, while rural Futou Lake has stabilized in a new regime with improved ecological resilience. Suburban Yanxi Lake is still moving toward a new state, and as such is unstable, because the types and magnitudes of external stressors are changing with urbanization in the city. It is suggested that active and precise management strategies for lakes should be established along the urban-rural gradient given their distinct development trajectories, drivers and current status.', 'The largest freshwater lake in China, the Poyang Lake, experienced a long history of evolution with combined influences from both climate factors and human activities. Along with the dramatic changes of water related disasters such as flood and drought, local society developed various strategies to cope with the water problems. This paper investigated the evolution of the Poyang Lake area, the flood and drought disasters, and the society resilience using statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Historical data on climate, population, flood and drought, water engineering, and social economics were collected to support a detailed examination of the climate-hazard-society relationships. The results indicate that: (a) the lake area was mainly influenced by the warm and rainy climate and expanded significantly before the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD). Since the large-scale southward population migration in the Yuan Dynasty, intensive reclamation of wetlands surrounding the lake plus the effects of a colder climate shrank the lake area sharply. (b) The frequency of water-related disasters was gradually increasing during the past 2000 years, especially since 12th century, as a result of climate change and population growth. (c) Despite significant change in climate and increasing flood and drought, local people in Poyang Lake area adopted various water engineering to prevent flood and coast training measures to protect farmland, which enabled the social surviving and continuous economic development. Social resilience in Poyang Lake was highly correlated with lake changes and associated water hazards. (d) Presently, more ecological strategies have been adopted to mitigate the risk of flood and drought at the Poyang Lake area.

In subarctic Quebec (Nunavik), they have grown in number and size since the mid-20th century. Recent studies have identified that these lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases. This is mainly due to the supply of catchment derived dissolved organic carbon that generates anoxic conditions leading to methane production. To assess the potential role of climate-driven changes in hydrological processes to influence greenhouse gas emissions, we utilized water isotope tracers to characterize the water balance of thermokarst lakes in Nunavik during three consecutive mid- to late summer sampling campaigns (2012-2014). Lake distribution stretches from shrub-tundra overlying discontinuous permafrost in the north to spruce-lichen woodland with sporadic permafrost in the south. Calculation of lake-specific input water isotope compositions (61) and lake-specific evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios based on an isotope-mass balance model reveal a narrow hydrological gradient regardless of diversity in regional landscape characteristics. Nearly all lakes sampled were predominantly fed by rainfall and/or permafrost meltwater, which suppressed the effects of evaporative loss. Only a few lakes in one of the southern sampling locations, which overly highly degraded sporadic permafrost terrain, appear to be susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown. We attribute this lake hydrological resiliency to the strong maritime climate in coastal regions of Nunavik. Predicted climate-driven increases in precipitation and permafrost degradation will likely contribute to persistence and expansion of thermokarst lakes throughout the region. If coupled with an increase in terrestrial carbon inputs to thermokarst lakes from surface runoff, conditions favorable for mineralization and emission of methane, these water bodies may become even more important sources of greenhouse gases.

Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to simulate pre-development, post-development, and postdevelopment with LID scenarios, incorporating bio-retention cells (BRC), permeable pavement (PP), and rain barrels (RB). A novel modified performance matrix, alongside traditional metrics, evaluated LID performance in restoring pre-development hydrological conditions. Results showed significant reductions in total outfall volume, peak runoff, and flood volume across all LID scenarios.

The Low Impact Development (LID) concept is considered as a potential solution for sustainable urban growth by contributing in urban flood mitigation. However, its effects on hydrologic response of the urbanized catchments, especially in broad scale implementation, are not fully understood and practically examined. In this study a hydrologic-hydraulic model of a small catchment was developed in EPA storm water management model (SWMM) program and calibrated and validated through field measurements. The hydrologic response of the catchment was investigated after replacing proportions of impervious surfaces with combinations of LID practices such as green roof, permeable pavement and bio-retention cell, through four land cover conversion scenarios and under five different designed storm events. The simulation results which are derived by comparison of outflow hydrographs between each scenario and conventional drainage system indicated that implementing 5-20% of LIDs has a noticeable impact on runoff peak flow and volume reduction, especially in storm events with shorter return periods. Also the runoff reduction trends show a linear response due to the increase in LID implementation ratio in the study area.', 'Lack of studies in developing countries with tropical climate such as the Philippines limit local LID adoption. This study compared the performance of different LID scenarios across different urban land use types at the subcatchment level using peak flow, runoff volume and flood reductions as performance criteria. Results showed that the most effective strategies for each land use are: 1) combined green roof and bioretention for low-density residential (reduction up to 10% peak flow, 11% runoff volume and 33% flood volume); 2) green roof for highdensity residential (8% peak flow, 6% runoff volume and 18% flood volume); 3) combined rain barrel, bioretention and permeable pavement for industrial (23% peak flow, 41% runoff volume and 56% flood volume), and 4) combined vegetative swale and detention pond for urban open spaces (81% peak flow, 8% runoff volume and 84% flood volume). While effective for most low intensity storms, the observed sharp decrease in LID performance with increased rainfall intensity poses a major challenge, especially in the context of the Philippines frequented by high intensity storms. This study also examined how differences in land use characteristics influence LID performance, unlike most studies that focused on LID type comparisons. It showed that low urban density setting positively affected peak flow and flood reduction performance of rain barrels and green roofs, while good drainage infrastructure quality positively affected peak flow and flood reduction performance of rain barrels and bioretention. Decision-makers may use these findings to conduct rapid assessments on LID selection and siting, provided similarities between land use characteristics described in this study and those at their localities are justified. This can lead to increased LID adoption towards building water resilient, and sustainable cities.']",NA,Flooding,Urban design and planning

The analysis considers factors impacting human health in two dimensions: 1) current state of the urban environment and 2) risk-informed urban planning and interventions. Specifically, it focuses on urban planning-related components relevant to public health. While no single framework was found to comprehensively cover all components of both dimensions, these indicator frameworks can complement each other to effectively support urban planning for resilient, sustainable and healthy cities.', 'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world, and the United States has become the epicenter of the global pandemic. However, little is known about the causes behind the large spatial variability of the COVID-19 incidence. Here we use path analysis model to quantify the influence of four potential factors (urban vegetation, population density, air temperature, and baseline infection) in shaping the highly heterogeneous transmission patterns of COVID-19 across the United States. Our results show that urban vegetation can slow down the spread of COVID-19, and each 1% increase in the percentage of urban vegetation will lead to a 2.6% decrease in cumulative COVID-19 cases. Additionally, the mediating role of urban vegetation suggests that urban vegetation could reduce increases in cumulative COVID-19 cases induced by population density and baseline infection. Our findings highlight the importance of urban vegetation in strengthening urban resilience to public health emergencies.']",NA,other,

The development of climate-resilient spring wheat cultivars able to maintain grain yield and quality is essential to food security and economic returns. We tested 54 CIMMYT spring bread wheat genotypes, developed and/or released over a span of 50 years, in the field for two years under optimum sowing dates, as well as using two delayed sowing dates to expose crops to medium and severe heat-stress conditions. The grain yield and yield components were severely affected as the heat-stress increased. Two contrasting groups of 10 lines each were identified to determine the effect of heat-stress on bread-making quality. The first set included entries that produced high yields in optimal conditions and maintained higher yields under heat-stress (superior-yielding lines), while the second set included genotypes that did not perform well in the environment with high temperature (inferior-yielding lines). We identified genotypes exhibiting bread-making quality stability, as well as the quality traits that had higher correlation with the loaf volume in the environment without stress and under heat-stress. Of all the quality traits tested, dough extensibility (AlvL) and grain protein content had a significant influence in heat-stress adaptation. Most of the lines from the superior-yielding group were also able to maintain and even improve quality characteristics under heat-stress and therefore, could be used as parents in breeding to develop high-yielding and stable quality wheat varieties.', 'Drought is the predominant cause of yield reduction in rainfed rice production systems, but until recently, little systematic effort has been made to breed drought-tolerant cultivars. The complex nature of drought tolerance, genotype x environment interaction, and the difficulty of effective drought tolerance screening complicate the development of drought tolerant varieties. This study reports on progress made by a collaborative network of Indian rice breeding programs, in partnership with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to develop lines combining high yield potential with drought tolerance by employing direct selection for grain yield under drought stress, and testing their performance in rainy season managed-drought screenings (RSMDS) of different stress severity levels at several locations during the main season in rainfed rice production areas in India. Advanced-generation breeding lines of less than 100 clays, 100-120 days. and greater than 120 days duration generated at eight national institutes and IRRI using diverse drought tolerant donors were evaluated in 2005-2007 under RSMDS. Stress was imposed at the reproductive stage, either by draining paddies shortly after transplanting for lowland trials, or by stopping irrigation before flowering for upland trials. Yield reduction of 34-53% under moderate stress and 65-88% under severe stress was achieved in comparison to irrigated controls. Several varieties that have been widely grown in rainfed environments in India for many years, including IR 36, IR 64, Mahamaya, Sambha Mahsuri, and Swarna, were shown to be highly susceptible. Breeding lines were identified that perform consistently better than these and other widely grown rainfed varieties under both moderate and severe drought stress without any yield penalty under fully irrigated conditions. In the combined analysis over locations and years, these promising breeding lines outyielded the widely grown controls by about 0.5 t ha(-1) under moderate stress and 0.7-1.0 t ha(-1) under severe stress. IRRI breeding lines contributed to the network were developed using a selection protocol involving replicated dry season managed-drought screening (DSMDS) in dry season at Los Banos, Philippines. For a subset of lines extensively tested both at IRRI and in India, correlations between yield under DSMDS in the Philippine and yield in RSMDS in India were moderately high, indicating the efficacy of dry-season MS screening at IRRI in identifying tolerant lines for India. Drought tolerant lines developed by the network members have been released in several Indian states and in the Philippines. Overall, these results indicate that managed stress screening for drought tolerance, with a focus on selection for yield under stress, is effective in generating drought-tolerant cultivars.

Although many international breeding programs are focused on developing high-temperature and drought-stress tolerant wheat varieties, changing weather patterns has increased the need to develop widely adaptable wheat varieties. Research was conducted to identify the potential resilience of spring wheat lines to heat and drought stresses and to define phenotypic and physiological traits that are associated with stress adaptation. A trial consisting of 28 newly developed spring wheat lines and two checks was tested under optimal, heat-, and drought-stress conditions for 2 yr in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. Phenotypic and physiological data was recorded in all environments. While a 50% reduction in mean grain yield was observed due to heat and drought stress, two distinct groups of stress-adapted lines were identified. In the first group, the wheat lines performed well in either heat-or drought-stress environment, and in the second group there were lines that produced high yields in optimal conditions and maintained higher yields under high temperature and drought stresses, with a yield advantage of 7 to 8% above the check varieties in the trial. Of the traits studied, grain weight per tiller (GWT) had significant influence in stress adaptation. Although heat-and drought-stress tolerance may involve different mechanisms, the results of this study show that it is possible to develop high-yielding heat-and drought-tolerant wheat varieties.']",NA,climate change,Food/agriculture

While flood resilience and risk are two distinct concepts with unique assessment metrics, there is lack of quantitative analysis and understanding of the relationship between them. This study aims to investigate this relationship at the grid cell level in urban areas. To assess flood resilience for high-resolution grid cells, this study proposes a performance-based flood resilience metric, which is calculated using the system performance curve based on flood duration and magnitude. Flood risk is calculated as the product of maximum flood depth and probability, considering multiple storm events. The case study of Waterloo in London, UK is analyzed using a two-dimensional cellular automata-based model CADDIES, which consists of 2.7 million grid cells (5 m x 5 m). The results indicate that over 2 % of grid cells have risk values exceeding 1. Furthermore, there is a 5 % difference in resilience values below 0.8 between the 200-year and 2000-year design rainfall events, specifically 4 % for the former and 9 % for the latter. Additionally, the results reveal a complex relationship between flood risk and resilience, though decreasing flood resilience generally leads to increasing flood risk. However, this relationship varies depending on the land cover type, with building, green land, and water body cells showing higher resilience for the same level of flood risk compared to other land uses such as roads and railways. Classifying urban areas into four categories, including high risk vs. low resilience, high risk vs. high resilience, low risk vs. low resilience, and low risk vs. high resilience, is crucial in identifying flood hotspots for intervention development. In conclusion, this study provides an in-depth understanding of the relationship between risk and resilience in urban flooding, which could help improve urban flood management. The proposed performance-based flood resilience metric and the findings from the case study of Waterloo in London could be valuable for decision-makers in developing effective flood management strategies in urban areas.', ""Unprecedented floods from extreme rainfall events worldwide emphasize the need for flood inundation mapping for floodplain management and risk reduction. Access to flood inundation maps and risk evaluation tools remains challenging in most parts of the world, particularly in rural regions, leading to decreased flood resilience. The use of hydraulic and hydrodynamic models in rural areas has been hindered by excessive data and computational requirements. In this study, we mapped the flood inundation in Huron Creek watershed, Michigan, USA for an extreme rainfall event (1000-year return period) that occurred in 2018 (Father's Day Flood) using the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model and a synthetic rating curve developed from LIDAR DEM. We compared the flood inundation extent and depth modeled by the HAND with flood inundation characteristics predicted by two hydrodynamic models, viz., HEC-RAS 2D and SMS-SRH 2D. The flood discharge of the event was simulated using the HEC-HMS hydrologic model. Results suggest that, in different channel segments, the HAND model produces different degrees of concurrence in both flood inundation extent and depth when compared to the hydrodynamic models. The differences in flood inundation characteristics produced by the HAND model are primarily due to the uncertainties associated with optimal parameter estimation of the synthetic rating curve. Analyzing the differences between the HAND and hydrodynamic models also highlights the significance of terrain characteristics in model predictions. Based on the comparable predictive capability of the HAND model to map flood inundation areas during extreme rainfall events, we demonstrate the suitability of the HAND-based approach for mitigating flood risk in data-scarce, rural regions."", 'High accuracy models are required for informed decision making in urban flood management. This paper develops a new holistic framework for using information collected from multiple sources for setting parameters of a 2D flood model.

A Cellular Automata based model CADDIES was used to simulate surface water flood inundation. Existing reports and flood photos obtained via social media were used to set model parameters and investigate different approaches for representing infiltration and drainage system capacity in urban flood modelling. The results of different approaches to processing terrain datasets indicate that the representation of urban micro-features is critical to the accuracy of modelling results. The constant infiltration approach is better than the rainfall reduction approach in representing soil infiltration and drainage capacity, as it describes the flood recession process better.

This upwards trend is projected to continue, highlighting the need for adequate adaptation strategies. This raises the question of how to determine which adaptation strategies are preferred to cope with uncertain climate change impacts. This study shows how a multi-disciplinary cascade of hazard modelling, risk modelling, and a cost-benefit analysis can be applied to provide a first indicator of economically efficient adaptation strategies. We apply this approach to an analysis of flood risk and the desirability of flood protection in the state of Tabasco in Mexico, which faces severe flooding on an almost yearly basis. The results show that expected annual damage caused by coastal flooding is expected to increase from 0.53 billion USD today up to 4.12 billion USD in 2080 due to socio-economic development and climate change. For river floods, expected annual damages are estimated to increase from 1.79 billion USD up to 10.6 billion USD in 2080 if no adaptation measures are taken. Based on the estimated risk and cost-benefit analysis of installing flood protection infrastructure, we determined the economically optimal protection standards for both river and coastal floods as at least 100 years, if we take into account climate change. Our main conclusions are robust to key uncertainties about climate change impacts on flood risks, indirect damage caused by floods, the width of the protected floodplains, and the adopted social discount rate. We discuss how our multi-disciplinary approach can assist policy-makers in decisions about flood risk management, and how future research can extend our method to more refined local analyses which are needed to guide local adaptation planning.', 'Pluvial flooding is a major concern in urban environments with limited or temporarily reduced efficiency of surface drainage. Climate change, land use change, and increased exposure in hazard prone areas play a role in increasing pluvial flood risks. We describe a methodology for rapid probabilistic pluvial flood hazard mapping and risk assessments in urban environments developed for the Copernicus Climate Change Service Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Areas demonstrator project for large computational domains. The methodology is designed to be flexible and robust enough to be adapted to other cities in Europe and elsewhere, and is composed of three main steps: (i) computation of the intensity-frequency relationship to express the depth of extreme hourly rainfall events at the urban scale; (ii) characterization of the pluvial flood hazard by means of raster-based flood modeling, and; (iii) estimation of the direct tangible damages at the building level for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Methods are tested for 20 cities across Europe and considering two infiltration rate scenarios. Spatial-explicit results at the urban-scale highlight the neighborhoods and sub-urban areas more adversely affected in terms of direct tangible damage to buildings and assets. Probabilistic risk assessment results indicate that Brussels, Antwerp, and London are the cities with higher expected annual damages per built-up area among the 20 cities considered in this study. These results can be useful for supporting the implementation of the Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030, for developing multi-hazard risk assessments, and for supporting the development of national climate change adaptation plans.', ""Many countries around the world face increasing impacts from flooding due to socio-economic development in flood-prone areas, which may be enhanced in intensity and frequency as a result of climate change. With increasing flood risk, it is becoming more important to be able to assess the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies. To guide the design of such strategies, policy makers need tools to prioritize where adaptation is needed and how much adaptation funds are required. In this country-scale study, we show how flood risk analyses can be used in cost-benefit analyses to prioritize investments in flood adaptation strategies in Mexico under future climate scenarios. Moreover, given the often limited availability of detailed local data for such analyses, we show how state-of-the-art global data and flood risk assessment models can be applied for a detailed assessment of optimal flood-protection strategies. Our results show that especially states along the Gulf of Mexico have considerable economic benefits from investments in adaptation that limit risks from both river and coastal floods, and that increased flood-protection standards are economically beneficial for many Mexican states. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to modelling uncertainties, the transferability of our modelling approach and policy implications.

CI network modeling methods are used to evaluate these hazards, enabling the analysis of cascading effects, flood risk, and potential flood risk-reducing measures. However, there is a lack of linkage between analytical methods and potential multisectoral, structural, and nonstructural measures. This deficiency impedes the development of CI network (CIN) models as robust tools for active flood risk management. CI operators have significant expertise in managing and implementing flooding-related measures within their sectors. The objective of this study is to bridge the gap between the application of CIN modeling and the consideration of flood measures in three steps. The first step is conducting a literature review and CI stakeholder interviews in Central Europe on flood measures. The second step is the culmination of the findings in a comprehensive catalog detailing flood measures tailored to five CI sectors, with a generalized category spanning each phase of the disaster risk management cycle. The third step is the validation of the catalog's utility in a proof-of-concept study along the Vicht River in Western Germany with a model-based flood risk analysis of five flood measures. The application of the flood measure catalog improves the options available for active and residual flood risk management. Additionally, the CI flood risk modeling approach presented here allows for consideration of disruption duration and recovery capability, thus linking the concept of risk and resilience.""]",NA,Flooding,Infrastructure

Within the vulnerability paradigm and the sustainable livelihood framework, the study also quantified and evaluated the relative contribution of natural resources to recovery strategies and the impacts on household financial capital. We found that natural resources contributed up to 70% to recovery of households from the flood shock, most of this being to reconstruct housing structures after the flood. Factors such as household head education level, household income, kinship level, the extent of property damage and the cost associated with property rehabilitation significantly influenced the uptake of natural resources in recovery from floods, and this was variable among settlements and towns.

A linear regression model between the thematic maps was performed to estimate the mangrove coverage change rate per pixel. Climate surfaces for annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature, and annual mean and cumulative precipitation for the region were calculated for the period 1980-2009 using data obtained from the National Meteorological Service. The effect of environmental variables on mangrove coverage change rates was assessed with a boosted generalized additive model (boosted GAM). The lowest and highest overall accuracy obtained for the time series thematic maps were 87.14% (Kappa = 0.78), and 97.5% (Kappa = 0.95), respectively. The most influential environmental variables on mangrove coverage change were annual cumulative precipitation (21%), and annual maximum temperature (9%).

We identified a 4.7% increase in the mangrove area of Parita Bay during the 32 years; the mangrove forests were also considered healthy as reflected by high NDVI values. However, the conversion of mangroves to other land cover types resulted in a 1.26% decline in mangrove cover from 1987 to 1998. Moreover, the area of aquaculture and saltpans almost doubled during this period. During the following two decades, the conversion of other land cover classes (water, other vegetation, and bare soil) increased the mangrove area by 6%, and the annual rate of increase was greater during the second decade (0.43% year(-1)). From 2009 to 2019, mangroves declined at an annual rate of 0.11% in protected areas and increased at an annual rate of 0.50% in unprotected areas. Despite the regeneration potential of mangrove forests, our study highlights the need to continually manage and protect mangrove forests in order to facilitate their expansion in Parita Bay.']",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

Here, we aim to determine whether, once introduced, plants assimilate into native communities or whether they aggregate, thus forming mosaics of native- and alien-rich communities. Alien species might aggregate in their non-native range owing to shared habitat preferences, such as their tendency to establish in high-biomass, species-poor areas. Location Twenty-two herbaceous grasslands in 14 countries, mainly in the temperate zone. Time period 2012-2016. Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We used a globally coordinated survey. Within this survey, we found 46 plant species, predominantly from Eurasia, for which we had co-occurrence data in their native and non-native ranges. We tested for differences in co-occurrence patterns of 46 species between their native (home) and non-native (away) range. We also tested whether species had similar habitat preferences, by testing for differences in total biomass and species richness of the patches that species occupy in their native and non-native ranges. Results We found the same species to show different patterns of association depending on whether they were in their native or non-native range. Alien species were negatively associated with native species; instead, they aggregated with other alien species in species-poor, high-biomass communities in their non-native range compared with their native range. Main conclusions The strong differences between the native (home) and non-native (away) range in species co-occurrence patterns are evidence that the way in which species associate with resident communities in their non-native range is not species dependent, but is instead a property of being away from their native range. These results thus highlight that species might undergo important ecological changes when introduced away from their native range. Overall, we show origin-dependent associations that result in novel communities, in which alien-rich patches exist within a mosaic of native-dominated communities.', 'Invasive species are a major driver of environmental change and pose a significPant threat to native biodiversity due to their ability to invade and establish themselves in natural or semi-natural ecosystems. This study analyzed the presence, abundance, and distribution of invasive alien plant species in a Mediterranean urban area, the municipality of C & oacute;rdoba (Andalusia region, southern Spain). It includes an important historic city center, urbanized areas but also peri-urban natural and semi-natural sites around. A detailed review of bibliography and computerized botanical databases was conducted prior to an extensive fieldwork and GIS analysis carried out during 2021, 2022, and 2023. Our research identified 227 populations of 17 invasive plant species from 10 different families. These species represent 35% of the invasive plant species reported in the Andalusia region and 27% of those reported in Spain. In total, 53% of the species were introduced from America, especially South America, but no alien invasive species from other European regions were detected. The highest concentrations were found in ruderal areas, followed by abandoned fields, but also in urbanized areas, including the UNESCO World Heritage historic city center. Seven invasive herbaceous species were identified (perennial herbs), compared to 10 invasive tree species, with phanerophytes being the most abundant life form. This likely reflects the predominant use of alien woody species for ornamental and reforestation purposes, as well as the greater resilience of woody and perennial species to the increasingly warm and dry conditions of the Mediterranean climate-a phenomenon exacerbated in recent years by climate change. Our findings suggest that the use of non-native species as ornamentals is the primary driver of the establishment, spread, and ecological impact of invasive plants in the study area. This study provides valuable insights into the current situation and the potential future trajectory of invasive species, facilitating the development of management strategies and restoration efforts to address the growing issue of biological invasions in the Mediterranean region.', 'The global challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change necessitate the implementation of integrated conservation strategies. A forward-looking framework is necessary to reconcile climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts with biodiversity goals, supporting effective long-term planning and management of protected areas (PAs) network. This study develops a comprehensive approach to identify priority areas for biodiversity conservation until 2050, integrating assessments of species distributions, climate change exposure and carbon storage under distinct shared socioeconomic pathways. The Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB) in China serves as a case study. Using an ensemble species distribution modeling (ESDM) method, we predicted the distributions of 435 threatened terrestrial vertebrate species and plants. We then mapped their richness in the MLYRB. Distance-based climate velocity analysis was performed to identify climate change coldspots and hotspots. The patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model and InVEST model were coupled to simulate carbon storage changes. Systematic conservation planning tool, Zonation, was used to prioritize species conservation hotspots. By examining the co-occurrence of these hotspots with climate change coldspots/hotspots and areas of high carbon storage, conservation priorities for the MLYRB were revealed. Our findings indicate that 18.27-24.94 % of the MLYRB risks over 20 % species richness declines by 2050 under various scenarios, while increases over 10 % are projected for only 0.81-1.75 % of the area. Cooccurrence analysis highlights significant associations, such as a 32.26 % overlap between species conservation hotspots and climate change hotspots in SSP1-2.6. Particularly noteworthy is the substantial co-occurrence (57.93-59.50 % across scenarios) between areas maximizing species conservation and carbon storage. The identified conservation priority areas, covering 41.95 % of the MLYRB (441554 km2), hold potential for long-term species conservation, climate resilience, and nature-based climate solutions by 2050. However, only 6.08 % of these priorities currently benefit from protection. These results offer valuable guidance for region-specific landscape management and conservation policy aligned with international goals. The presented methodology provides a broader application, serving as a valuable resource for prioritizing conservation efforts in other regions integrating biodiversity, climate change adaptation, and mitigation goals.']",NA,other,

This study evaluated the strength and environmental performance of asphalt mixtures containing different proportions of Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) for road pavement surfacing. Laboratory experiments and environmental life cycle assessment were conducted for different asphalt mixtures. The mixture was evaluated based on their stability/Global Warming Potential (GWP), resilient modulus/GWP, and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS)/GWP ratios. The mixture containing 40% coarse RCA was judged to be the most efficient based on its highest resilient modulus/GWP and ITS/GWP ratios of 108.30 MPa/kg CO2 eq and 11.75 kPa/kg CO2 eq, respectively. These values are about 9% and 4% higher than the control values for the two indicators, respectively. The study recommended 40% partial replacement of granite with RCA in Stone Mastic Asphalt for optimum strength and environmental impact.', ""One alternative measure to minimise the stormwater runoff volume and its pollutants and reduce impervious areas is to use permeable pavement. However, due to weak mechanical performance under heavy-load traffic related to fatigue resistance, porous mixtures and permeable pavements have restricted applications, i.e., parking lots and low-traffic roads. This work aims to evaluate the fatigue resistance of a porous asphalt mixture produced with highly modified asphalt (HiMA) and its potential contribution to reducing stormwater runoff and pollutants. In order to estimate the capability of runoff pollutants and stormwater flood reduction, a case study was performed on an urban road. A permeable pavement was designed using the porous mixture as a surface layer. The mixture volumetric parameters and asphalt content were established using the Marshall method, considering the void content, interconnected voids, permeability, Cantabro test, and moisture damage test evaluation. The resilient modulus and fatigue resistance tests were performed on a diametral compression device. The mixture design resulted in an asphalt content of 5.1% and a void content of 21.5%. The resilient modulus was 2764 MPa, and the porous mixture obtained excellent fatigue performance, allowing its application in diverse traffic conditions. The porous mixture efficiency infiltration capacity was 90%, and some runoff pollutants could be reduced after being filtered by the pavement surface, contributing to minimizing environmental contamination. This work filled part of a gap in predicting porous mixtures' fatigue performance, collaborating to popularise and expand its use for various purposes."", 'Global warming and reduced available energy resources have provided strong incentives to find alternative materials and technologies for the construction of pavements. Technologies such as asphalt recycling or warm mix asphalt (WMA) can provide several economic and environmental benefits. This research was initiated to investigate the mechanical and durability performance of WMA mixtures containing 0% and 50% reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) made with different types of WMA additives including Sasobit (R), Kaowax (R), Zeolite (R), and PAWMA (R). For this purpose, various mechanical tests including dynamic creep at 54.4 degrees C, resilient modulus at three temperatures of 5 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 40 degrees C, indirect tensile strength (ITS) at 25 degrees C, and semi-circular bending (SCB) fracture at about 25 degrees C were conducted. The durability performance of the mixtures was evaluated by calculating the tensile strength ratio (TSR) to investigate the moisture susceptibility of the mixtures. The findings indicated that the mechanical performance of the mixtures depends on the type of WMA additive. Among all the WMA additives evaluated in this study, only PAWMA (R) decreased the resistance of asphalt mixture to moisture damage. Although the incorporation of RAP material into asphalt mixtures decreases the flexibility and cracking resistance of the mixtures, it leads to a significant improvement in resisting the damages associated with rutting. The mixture containing RAP and Kaowax (R) resulted in the highest flow number value, while the HMA mixture containing Zeolite (R) resulted in the lowest flow number value. Moreover, the incorporation of RAP material into asphalt mixtures was found to enhance the moisture damage resistance, the asphalt mixtures containing RAP and PAWMA (R) showed the highest resistance to moisture damage among all the mixtures studied in this research. In addition, the asphalt mixtures containing RAP and made with Sasobit (R) or PAWMA (R) showed the highest resilient modulus and cracking resistance among all the mixtures, respectively.

Achieving this goal requires a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition of the interconnections among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly coupled socioecological and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress (WFC) convenes every four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and discuss threats, issues, and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries. The 2021 WFC meeting, hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th year since the first meeting was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity to reflect on progress made in the past 30 years and provide guidance for the future. We assembled a diverse team of individuals involved with the Adelaide WFC and reflected on the major challenges that faced fish and fisheries over the past 30 years, discussed progress toward overcoming those challenges, and then used themes that emerged during the Congress to identify issues and opportunities to improve sustainability in the world's fisheries for the next 30 years. Key future needs and opportunities identified include: rethinking fisheries management systems and modelling approaches, modernizing and integrating assessment and information systems, being responsive and flexible in addressing persistent and emerging threats to fish and fisheries, mainstreaming the human dimension of fisheries, rethinking governance, policy and compliance, and achieving equity and inclusion in fisheries. We also identified a number of cross-cutting themes including better understanding the role of fish as nutrition in a hungry world, adapting to climate change, embracing transdisciplinarity, respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, thinking ahead with foresight science, and working together across scales. By reflecting on the past and thinking about the future, we aim to provide guidance for achieving our mutual goal of sustaining vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit all. We hope that this prospective thinking can serve as a guide to (i) assess progress towards achieving this lofty goal and (ii) refine our path with input from new and emerging voices and approaches in fisheries science, management, and stewardship."", ""Climate change impacts on the fisheries can be short-term or long-term, making them highly vulnerable. Fishers' vulnerability encompasses several factors and includes, among others, their sensitivity, exposure to the elements, and their adaptive capacity. The main aim of this study was to help develop a vulnerability assessment tool that can be applied in the various nodes of the fisheries and aquaculture value chains with a long-term view of enhancing the resilience of the fisheries and helping increase the adaptive capacity of the fishing communities. A participatory technique using online workshops was conducted together with various stakeholders (N = 214) who gave insights and suggested indicators that drive climate change impacts and vulnerability. Based on the online workshops conducted, the common hazards/drivers were increasing temperature, typhoons, flooding (sealevel rise), and the recent pandemic, which consequently destroy coral reef ecosystems, affect fisheries yield, increases fish mortality, damage boats, fishing gears, pens, cages, pond dikes, erode beach properties, and devastate houses. In association with these impacts, mobility, travel, processing, and logistic operations are severely reduced. In the human dimension, the fishers and fish farmers are directly affected in terms of income loss, destroyed fishing gears, nutritional deficiencies and health impacts, less fishing operations, early or reduced harvest yield, and low market value of products. In the adaptation options, the infrastructure, social, economic, awareness/knowledge, and relevant governance/policy dimensions are needed to address and help mitigate various climate change impacts."", ""The impacts of climate change on Taiwanese marine capture fisheries have been observed in several studies. To help decision makers develop appropriate, fishery-related measures to enhance the resilience or social adaptation capacity to respond to climate change, an analysis of fishers' perceptions and their adaptation is needed. This study selected Keelung City, New Taipei City, and Yilan County as case studies for analyzing fishers' perceptions on climate change in northeastern Taiwan. To meet research objectives, we conducted a questionnaire survey to interview 273 fishers who have experiences of capture fishing. Then, descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and logistic regression were used for empirical analysis. The results indicated that a total of 81% of respondents might adapt their fishing behavior in response to climate change. The empirical results show that the respondents who recognized the importance of risk controls and the impacts on marine physical environments might change fishing behaviors in response to climate change. Also, the respondents who have substantial experience fishing might adapt their fishing behaviors in response to climate change. Elderly respondents might not adapt their fishing behaviors in response to climate change. Based on the findings, three management recommendations for related policies are offered: (1) a modified incentive program to attract younger labor forces to join the fishing industry; (2) an early-warning or weather information system; and (3) marine resources management measures. The results provide a valid foundation for management agencies of coastal and offshore fisheries under climate change.""]",NA,climate change,Ecosystems

Since 2013, the project has been expanded as an international Research and Development Project (RDP) of the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Through this project, the following results were obtained: 1) observation data for LHIW around Tokyo were recorded using a dense network of X-band radars, a C-band polarimetric radar, a Ku-band fast-scanning radar, coherent Doppler lidars, and the Global Navigation Satellite System; 2) quantitative precipitation estimation algorithms for X-band polarimetric radars have been developed as part of an international collaboration; 3) convection initiation by the interaction of sea breezes and urban impacts on the occurrence of heavy precipitation around Tokyo were elucidated by a dense observation network, high-resolution numerical simulations, and different urban surface models; 4) an imminent nowcast system based on the vertically integrated liquid water derived from the X-band polarimetric radar network has been developed; 5) assimilation methods for data from advanced observation instruments such as coherent Doppler lidars and polarimetric radars were developed; and 6) public use of high-resolution radar data were promoted through the social experiments.', ""Urban floods repeatedly threaten Barcelona, damaging the city infrastructure and endangering the safety of the population. The urban planning of the city, the socioeconomic distribution, its topography, and the characteristics of precipitation systems translate into these flood events having a heterogeneous effect across the city. It means that the coping capacity has a strong dependence on local factors that must be considered when management plans are developed by the municipality. This work aims to contribute to the better knowledge of precipitation structures associated with heavy rainfall events and floods in Barcelona based on radar data and an urban rain gauge network. Radar data have been provided by the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC), while precipitation data, impact data, and early warnings, have been provided by Barcelona Cicle de l'Aigua S.A. (BCASA), for the period 2013-2018. A new radar-based methodology has been developed to identify convective rainfall structures from radar reflectivity volumes (CAPPI and TOP products) to make the analysis easier. The high computing speed of the procedure allows efficient analysis of a large set of convective cells without scarifying temporal resolution of radar data. Both rainfall fields (radar and rain gauge, respectively) have been compared. Then through the identified rainfall convective structures, thunderstorm hotspots have been identified. Considering an alert indicator from BCASA and the reported incidents, episodes with the highest impact have been analysed in depth. Results show 207 significant rainfall episodes in the ROI for the six years, which are mainly concentrated between September and November. The fact that significant episodes are usually produced by highly convective rain corroborates the advantage of using radar images as a tool to detect any maxima even when no rain gauge is there. In 64 of the episodes, the level of pre-alert was achieved with a maximum frequency between August and September. The proposed algorithm shows more than 8000 centroids of convective cells from 189 cases. Whilst maximum surface reflectivity over 45 dBZ is more prone to occur near the coastline, the centroids of storm cells tend to concentrate more inland. The final objective is to improve the actions taken by the organisation responsible for managing urban floods, which have seen Barcelona recognised as a model city for flood resilience by the United Nations."", ""Precipitation risk and water management is a key challenge for densely populated urban areas. Applications derived from high spatio-temporal resolution observation of precipitations are to make our cities more weatherready. Finer resolution data available from dual polarised X-band radar measurements enhance engineering tools as used for urban planning policies as well as protection (mitigation/adaptation) strategies to tackle climate-change related weather events. For decades engineering tools have been developed to work conveniently either with very local rain gauge networks, or with mainly C-band radars that have gradually been set up for space-time remote sensing of precipitation. Most of the time, the C-band radars continue to be calibrated by the existing rain gauge networks. Inhomogeneous distributions of these networks lead to only a partial information on the rainfall fields. Here we show that the statistics of measured rainfall is strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks and that this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields, in spite of the radar data calibration. In this work, we use the semi-distributed hydrological modelling over the Bievre catchment to generate a virtual rain gauges' network. And, firstly, performing a fractal analysis of this network distribution, we demonstrate that the semi-distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the distributed (weather radar) rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges. Then, with the help of the Intersection Theorem and multifractal theory, we statistically compare the virtual rain gauges' data with the rainfall data measured by the dual-polarimetric X-band radar operated at Ecole des Ponts with a spatial resolution of 250 m, providing pre-factors that indicate the need of a proper renormalisation of rain gauge rainfall data when comparing (or calibrating) with radar data and the possible counter productivity of this conditioning.""]",NA,Flooding,Infrastructure
